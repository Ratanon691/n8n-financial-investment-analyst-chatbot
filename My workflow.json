          "content": "NEW YORK, July  16, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in Apple, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nInvestors have until August 19, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Apple securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Tucker v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 5:25-cv-05197.\n\nWhy was Apple Sued for Securities Fraud?\n\nApple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of smart-devices and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Apple’s software includes a digital personal assistant called “Siri,” which was first introduced in October 2011. The complaint alleges that Apple misrepresented Siri’s advanced AI-based features as well as its ability to deliver them within the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nIn truth, as alleged, Apple lacked a functional prototype of Siri’s purported advanced AI-based features and misrepresented the time it would take to integrate such features into its devices.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced it was indefinitely delaying several AI-based Siri features, citing development delays and pushing their release to sometime “in the coming year.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $11.59 per share, or almost 5%, from $239.07 per share on March 7, 2025, to $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nThen, on June 9, 2025, Apple hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference for 2025. Noticeably, Apple failed to announce any new updates regarding advanced Siri features. Analysts and media outlets described the WWDC as “underwhelming” and “disappointing,” with CNN stating that “it’s unlikely that any of the announcements made at Monday’s event will change the perception that Apple is behind its competitors in AI.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $2.47 per share, or over 1%, from $203.92 on June 6, 2025, to $201.45 per share on June 9, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Apple you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

          "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares tick higher in pre-market trading after the company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, though looming pharmaceutical tariffs from President Trump remain a key risk for the sector.\n\nMP Materials (MP) stock jumped after Apple (AAPL) announced a $500 million deal to buy rare earth magnets and build a rare earth recycling facility in California.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief: Market Sunrise here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nNow some more breaking news on the earnings front, as the pharma sector braces for more clarity on tariffs. Johnson & Johnson reporting earnings this morning, kicking off earnings for the healthcare sector. The company reporting second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.77, but keep, keep part of this release really is the company boosting its full-year sales outlook and boosting its full-year earnings outlook, its profit outlook. So Johnson & Johnson now seeing full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $10.80 to $10.90, previously it had guided for a range of $10.50 to $10.70. On full-year sales, the company now sees a range of $93 or sorry, $93.2 billion to $93.6 billion, previously it had seen a range of 91 to 91.8. So you're seeing stock slightly higher here up a little bit over 1% on this boosted forecast. But key though for the sector, as we had talked about earlier this morning for Johnson & Johnson, is the fact that pretty soon President Trump has warned that there will be tariffs coming on the pharma sector. So it will be interesting to see of course how those could impact this company, what management says on the call about this about those tariffs and looming risks when it comes to that. Now you might have also heard about MP Materials in recent days. That stock closed 20% higher on Tuesday, and this is another trending ticker that I want to highlight for us. That stock is up about 4.5% in pre-market up almost 4% now. The fresh surge in MP, that's the ticker, comes after Apple announced that it would buy rare earth magnets from the company in a $500 million deal. The deal will sell, we'll see Apple and MP materials launch a recycling facility in California for processing and we'll be keeping a close eye on MP materials over the next several sessions.

          "content": "Key Points\n\nApple, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola are among Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. Those looking for passive income will find compelling opportunities in these three positions. Various industries are represented in the portfolio, such as AI, electric vehicles, and energy. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nWarren Buffett -- one of the most highly esteemed investors of all time, if not the most -- has been a consistent source of investing insights for decades. In addition to his numerous pearls of wisdom, the stock purchases Buffett makes through his conglomerate, BerkshireHathaway, are also closely followed.\n\nHere are 10 stocks from the Berkshire portfolio that bear the Buffett seal of approval and are worth loading up on right now.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThough not a major holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) demands serious consideration from investors seeking exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), e-commerce, and other segments. Its Amazon Web Services unit, in particular, continues to be a great growth engine for the company, and it will likely remain so for many years to come as AI flourishes.\n\nShares look attractively valued now at 17.7 times operating cash flow, compared to its five-year average cash flow multiple of 20.4.\n\n2. Apple\n\nThe largest holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has plunged almost 16% year to date as of this writing. Thanks to its fiercely loyal customer base, it steadily generates strong profits and cash flows.\n\nWith the haircut it has received so far in 2025, investors have the chance to pick up shares of the tech stalwart at a lower price point than when the year began.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC), one of the nation's largest financial institutions, demonstrated its sound financial health during the recent 2025 stress test. It has rewarded shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend over the past decade, making Bank of America a great choice for those interested in a leading financial stock, but who are not interested in large exposure to the risks in smaller regional banks.\n\n4. BYD\n\nAlthough BYD's (OTC: BYDD.F) electric vehicles (EV) aren't seen on American highways and byways, the company's dominance in the global EV market is indisputable. Investors have pumped the brakes on BYD stock over the past month, and shares are available on the cheap, trading at 2.5 times forward earnings.\n\n5. Chevron\n\nFor an opportunity to add ample passive income into investors' portfolios, there's Chevron(NYSE: CVX). This oil giant has consistently increased its dividend -- now offering a 4.5% forward yield -- for nearly four decades. Despite the downturn in energy prices over the past year, Chevron stock has remained resilient, demonstrating its allure as a way to gain energy exposure.\n\nStory Continues\n\n6. Coca-Cola\n\nThe fourth-largest Berkshire Hathaway position, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), first appeared in the portfolio in 1988. The company, founded in 1886, now owns a variety of beverage brands beyond soft drinks, making it the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company. It's a Dividend King, having logged 63 consecutive years of payout growth.\n\n7. Kraft Heinz\n\nDown about 17% since the start of 2025, Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) has fallen out of favor with investors due to lagging sales, yet there are numerous reasons not to dismiss this food and beverage leader. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, and shares are inexpensively valued at 10.1 times forward earnings.\n\n8. Moody's\n\nThe credit ratings, research, and risk analysis services that Moody's(NYSE: MCO) provides allow businesses and investors to make more informed financial decisions. Its invaluable services will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future, making it a worthy consideration for investors looking to fortify their portfolios with a more conservative opportunity.\n\n9. Occidental Petroleum\n\nUnlike Chevron's operations up and down the energy value chain, OccidentalPetroleum(NYSE: OXY) is an oil and gas company focused (though not exclusively) on exploration and production in the United States. This business model means the stock is highly correlated with energy prices, illustrating why it's down almost 25% over the past year. But the shares should recover and be a long-term winner.\n\n10. Visa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) has about 1.3 billion credit cards in circulation worldwide, an impressive global presence. With the various fees it collects from users, the company generates consistently strong cash flows. From 2015 through 2024, for example, Visa grew its free cash flow at a 15% compound annual rate.\n\nThe stock has provided stellar returns for investors over the long term, and the company's growth potential suggests that its shares will soar even higher in years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

During that span, though, Apple stock has underperformed Google, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia by a country mile. Lauren, what happened to Apple? It used to be I mean, everybody seemingly owns Apple, but now they are perhaps owning more of everything else in the AI space.\n\n00:43 Lauren\n\nWell, I can't speak to Apple specifically, but I can speak to something I see very clearly happening within this, uh, this tech space. We've spoken a lot today about the foundational layer of artificial intelligence, the semiconductor chip makers, uh, manufacturers. Um, we haven't spoken as much about the infrastructure layer, the energy companies. And then there's a third layer, the application layer. And this is where many companies outside of Apple have had more early, um, releases, opportunities for their customers to deeply engage with new functions related to AI and what that can do in their daily lives. And that application layer, we are really only in the very earliest, I would even say pre-stages of what that will look like, not only for us as consumers, but also for businesses and the technologies that they use to enable their workforce. And so I would say, um, the jury is still certainly out over who the winners and losers will be. And elements of, um, data and personal security, where Apple has historically been strong, might be areas that, uh, gain more importance as this application layer builds out.\n\n02:34 Brian Sozzi\n\nUh, Allie, I I'm going to decode this movement in in, uh, Apple in real time. I'm using my iPhone to download AI applications from everybody else. And until Apple comes out with its own AI functions, they need to do They're not They're unlikely to regain that story, that that bullish thesis.\n\n03:02 Alexandra Canal\n\nYeah, and that's a big reason why we've seen these year-to-date declines. They've just disappointed on the AI story. And fun fact, B. Brian, Nvidia is $1 trillion larger than Apple at the current moment. That just gives some perspective here. But to Lauren's point, the use cases on the consumer side for AI, we just haven't been there yet. And that's an area that down the line, Apple could potentially double down on it, and we could see that momentum. Right now, it's really focused on those hyperscalers, a lot of B2B, for a company like Meta that's been utilized by its advertisers, especially its smaller advertisers. So that's why we've been able to to see these outside gains in some of these other MAG 7 companies. Apple typically They're not the innovators here. They usually sit back, they wait for the innovators to to do their thing, and then they come in and make a better product. So that could be something that we see down the line here. Uh, you know, Apple also focused on that user privacy data. We have seen some, you know, shaky data with, uh, Chat GPT, Gemini, those types of products. So again, something that Apple might just want to sit on their heels and wait a little bit.\n\n04:43 Brian Sozzi\n\nJust fix Siri, please, Apple, and tell us things aren't going to be, uh, bad in China.

The U.S. does not reach such a deal with China.\n\nFebruary 10 - Trump raises tariffs on steel and aluminum to a flat 25% \"without exceptions or exemptions\".\n\nMarch 3 - Trump says 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada will take effect from March 4 and doubles fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20%.\n\nMarch 6 - Trump exempts goods from Canada and Mexico under a North American trade pact for a month.\n\nMarch 26 - Trump unveils a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks.\n\nApril 2 - Trump announces global tariffs with a baseline of 10% across all imports and significantly higher duties on some of the United States’ biggest trading partners.\n\nApril 9 - Trump pauses for 90 days most of his country-specific tariffs that kicked in less than 24 hours earlier after an upheaval in financial markets erased trillions of dollars from bourses around the world.\n\nThe 10% blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports stays in place.\n\nTrump says he will raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that took effect a day earlier. This pushes the extra duties on Chinese goods to 145%, including the previously imposed tariffs.\n\nMay 9 - Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announce a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place 10% tariffs on British exports and lowers U.S. duties on British car exports.\n\nMay 12 - The U.S. and China agree to temporarily slash reciprocal tariffs. Under the 90-day truce, the U.S. will cut the extra tariffs it imposed on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China’s duties on U.S. imports will be slashed to 10% from 125%.\n\nMay 13 - The U.S. cuts the low value \"de minimis\" tariff on China shipments, reducing duties for items valued at up to $800 to 54% from 120%.\n\nMay 23 - Trump says he is recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the European Union starting on June 1. He backpedals on this threat two days later.\n\nHe also warns Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) it would face a 25% tariff if phones it sold in the U.S. were manufactured outside of the country.\n\nMay 29 - A federal appeals court temporarily reinstates the most sweeping of Trump’s tariffs, pausing an earlier lower court’s ruling to consider the government’s appeal.\n\nJune 3 - Trump signs an executive proclamation activating a hike in the steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% from 25%.\n\nJune 12 - Trump warns he may soon hike auto tariffs.\n\nJuly 3 - Trump says the U.S. will place a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports, with trans-shipments from third countries through Vietnam facing a 40% levy.\n\nJuly 6 - Trump says on Truth Social that countries aligning themselves with the \"Anti-American policies\" of BRICS will be charged an additional 10% tariff.\n\nJuly 7 - Trump says on Truth Social the additional higher duties announced in earlier months will kick in with a delay on August 1. In letters sent to 14 countries including Japan, South Korea and Serbia, he says that will include tariffs between 25% and 40%.\n\nJuly 10 - Trump says the U.S. will impose a 35% tariff on imports from Canada in August and plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most other trading partners.\n\nJuly 12 - Trump threatens to impose a 30% tariff on imports from Mexico and the EU from August 1.\n\nJuly 15 - Trump says the U.S. will impose a 19% tariff on goods from Indonesia under a new agreement. </p>",

          "title": "Here's Why Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is a Buy Before Aug. 2",
          "content": "Key Points\n\nBerkshire is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Saturday, Aug. 2.  There are a few numbers that Berkshire investors will be watching closely. Berkshire’s stock looks like a strong value right now. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) presents its earnings reports a little differently. For one thing, management doesn't hold quarterly earnings calls like most companies do. And CEO Warren Buffett insists on releasing earnings reports on Saturdays, so investors will have plenty of time to digest the numbers before the stock market opens.\n\nThere are a few key numbers investors will be watching when Berkshire reports its second-quarter results, expected on Saturday, Aug. 2. Berkshire's operating earnings from its businesses is the most obvious example. There's also the company's cash stockpile, which reached an all-time high of $347.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nFinally, while we won't know what specific stocks Berkshire bought and sold until a few weeks after its earnings report when it has to file with the government, we can typically figure out if Berkshire was a net buyer or seller of stocks during the quarter by looking at the reported cost basis of its investment portfolio. And we'll also get details about whether Berkshire decided to buy back any of its own stock.\n\nIn this article, I'll discuss why this trillion-dollar company could be a solid investment before earnings.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire should be more valuable now\n\nDuring the second quarter, which is the period Berkshire is getting ready to report, the S&P 500 increased by 10.4%, and many of Berkshire's top stock holdings performed quite well. Although Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell slightly during the quarter on tariff concerns, Berkshire's second- and third-largest investments, American Express(NYSE: AXP) and Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), increased by 20% and 15%, respectively, during the second quarter. Despite all of this, Berkshire's stock is significantly lower than where it started the quarter, mainly because CEO Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the company's May annual meeting.\n\nAlso, while we won't know Berkshire's stock portfolio activity for the second quarter until mid-August, it's highly likely that Berkshire's already massive $348 billion cash stockpile has grown even larger. However, as I'll discuss in a bit, I also wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that Berkshire had resumed buybacks in the second quarter, which could limit the growth of the company's cash.\n\nFinally, Berkshire has a collection of (mostly) tariff-resistant businesses. Of course, there could still be some secondary impacts of tariffs on businesses that operate exclusively in the U.S., but Berkshire is more insulated from the impacts of import tariffs than most.\n\nA better value than you might think\n\nAt the current stock price, Berkshire Hathaway has a market cap of about $1.02 trillion, which is significantly less than just a couple months ago, before Buffett announced his planned retirement. Meanwhile, the value of the stock portfolio has increased significantly, and Berkshire still has the same (or more) cash.\n\nThink of it this way. Berkshire's stock portfolio is worth approximately $292 billion as of this writing. Removing that and the $348 billion in cash shows a valuation of about $380 billion for Berkshire's operating businesses.\n\nWe'll get updated numbers soon, but Berkshire has generated about $33 billion in operating profit from its businesses over the past four quarters, excluding investment income. This shows that the market is valuing Berkshire's businesses at just 11.5 times operating earnings. The last time I looked at the numbers was late May, and this ratio was 14. That's why I wouldn't be shocked if we find out Berkshire resumed buybacks.\n\nIs Berkshire a buy before earnings?\n\nTo be sure, I have no idea what Berkshire Hathaway's earnings will be, and some parts of the report (insurance underwriting income, for example) can be rather unpredictable. But the bottom line is that this is a rock-solid business trading well below highs at a time when the S&P 500 is near its all-time peak.\n\nWarren Buffett's departure isn't likely to have any massive impact on the day-to-day business; Berkshire still has an excellent team of leaders; and the company has unmatched financial flexibility to pursue opportunities if and when they arise. Berkshire is already one of the largest stock investments in my portfolio, but if the current price level persists, I'm likely to add shares. It is a buy before earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

          "title": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
          "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you're looking to park in an investment worth owning for a while? That's easier said than done right now. Although the market isn't exactly dangerous at this time, stocks are relatively expensive, given the degree of economic uncertainty ahead.\n\nNevertheless, a handful of tickers are not only still worth owning here but also worth buying at their current prices. If you need help finding some of these names, just start with the stocks Warren Buffett is holding, if not buying more of.\n\nTo this end, here's a closer look at three stocks currently found in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio that would likely be at home in your portfolio, too.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nIt's not entirely clear what Buffett himself sees in Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI), but he clearly sees something. Berkshire's 110 million-share stake in the company is one-third of Sirius itself, thanks to the purchase of another $42 million worth of the stock just within the past few days.\n\nOf course, Sirius XM is North America's one and only satellite radio service, although the company is more than that. In addition to web-accessible access to its satellite-delivered programming, Sirius owns the internet radio platform Pandora. Roughly three-fourths of its revenue comes from subscription fees, and most of the rest comes from advertising.\n\nIt's a business model that's being increasingly questioned, and understandably so. There's a virtual universe of audio entertainment available online, and Pew Research reports that 90% of adults living in the United States own a smartphone -- they have their own web-connected entertainment device with them at all times, in and out of a vehicle.\n\nConsumers arguably don't need satellite radio anymore. In this vein, the company's subscriber base has dwindled from its late-2022 peak of nearly 32.4 million to just under 31.5 million paying customers as of the middle of this year. It's not catastrophic, but it is a concern.\n\nThis attrition may also have run its full course, however, and is set to reverse direction. Sirius is still adding new podcasts, overhauling its pricing plans, and -- thanks to the introduction of an advertising-sales technology (Trade Desk's Unified ID 2.0, to be specific) -- is well positioned to grow the advertising aspect of its business, which will ultimately make its programming cheaper (or even free) to tune in to. This will also create and free up funds to do more marketing.\n\nOf course, Sirius XM stock's forward-looking dividend yield of 4% isn't too shabby either.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nOil and gas stocks haven't always been Warren Buffett's cup of tea. Although most of these tickers pay good dividends when they can, these companies' bottom lines are closely tethered to unpredictable oil prices. The Oracle of Omaha generally isn't into these kinds of guessing games.\n\nThat's what makes his commitment to energy outfit Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) so interesting -- and telling. Since it was first added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio back in 2022, not only has Buffett continued to add to the position, but he's also made a point of touting it. As he wrote in this year's letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:\n\nUnder Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\n\nBuffett adds, \"We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States,\" most of which are in the well-proven Permian Basin and nearby areas.\n\nBut wait -- isn't the crude oil business on its way out? Not so fast.\n\nWhile renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are obviously the future, there's a growing need for power right now. It could take decades for this transition to do any permanent damage to the oil and gas business. Indeed, Bloomberg expects demand for oil to continue growing through 2035, with this demand only waning about 10% from that 2035 peak by 2050.\n\nTranslation: There's a lot of money to be made by extracting oil and gas from the ground in the meantime. Now, all of a sudden, Warren Buffett's seemingly unlikely interest in Occidental makes a lot of sense.\n\nBank of America\n\nFinally, add Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) to your list of Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now.\n\nIt's an eyebrow-raising call. If you keep tabs on Warren Buffett's trades, then you likely know Berkshire's been shedding its Bank of America (BofA) stake since the middle of this year, paring back its position in the big bank by about one-fourth of its peak size. He's still actively selling this stock, too. Plenty of investors have been interpreting these sales as a sign of impending trouble for the bank.\n\nAnd, perhaps, Buffett is concerned about the company's foreseeable future.\n\nThere's also a distinct possibility, however, that Berkshire's simply scaling back on a (very) profitable trade before potential changes in tax laws can go into effect that might make unrealized gains on big trades taxable. In this vein, Berkshire has also been selling pieces of its profitable position in Apple of late, which is still Berkshire's biggest trade despite the recent culling.\n\nAlso, even with the frantic panic resulting from the streak of sales since July, the remaining 766 million-share, $32.4 billion stake in BofA leaves it as Berkshire's third-biggest holding. Maybe Buffett is just trying to reduce his position in BofA to less than 10% of the bank itself, which lifts the requirement to immediately disclose any buys or sales of the stock in question.\n\nSure, like most other banks, this one's grappling with waning loan demand and rising loan defaults. Last quarter's net interest income slipped 3% year over year, while charge-offs for soured loans -- although still absorbable -- grew 65% for the same timeframe.\n\nThere's a reason shares of Bank of America have been climbing since August's low, however, and are back within sight of new 52-week highs. Take that hint while the stock's forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 2.5%. You'll be plugging into one of the biggest leading names in a business the world absolutely needs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "[President Trump Departs The White House For Pittsburgh]\nAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images News\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month, with levies on semiconductors potentially following a similar timeline.\n\n“Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff,” Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington following an AI summit in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe added that tariffs on chips would follow a “similar” timeline and described them as “less complicated” to implement, though he did not elaborate.\n\nTrump previously announced plans for a 50% tariff on copper and launched a Section 232 investigation into drug imports, citing national security threats. The pharmaceutical duties could rise as high as 200% after the initial phase-in, posing risks to companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE]), Merck (NYSE:MRK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK]), and Eli Lilly (LLY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY]), which rely on overseas production. Semiconductor tariffs are expected to affect both chipmakers and electronics manufacturers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF]).\n\nTrump said he’s in talks with five to six countries and may strike “two or three” deals before his reciprocal tariffs take effect August 1, adding that a deal with India was among the most likely. “I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” he said.\n\nRelated chip stocks: AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD]), Broadcom (AVGO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO]), Qualcomm (QCOM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM]), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM]), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU]), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]), Applied Materials (AMAT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT]), KLA (KLAC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAC]), ASML (ASML [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML]) and Lam Research (LRCX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX]).\n\nMORE ON PFIZER, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, ETC.\n\n \t* TSMC's Q2 Earnings Preview - More Strength To Come [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801243-tsmc-stock-q2-earnings-preview-more-strength-to-come]\n \t* Taiwan Semiconductor: The 'Go To' Factory For AI Boom [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801144-taiwan-semiconductor-the-go-to-factory-for-ai-boom]\n \t* Intel Is Not For The Faint Of Heart [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800906-intel-is-not-for-the-faint-of-heart]\n \t* MP Materials rips to all-time high after $500M deal that ensures Apple supply apart from China [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467674-mp-materials-rips-to-all-time-high-after-500m-deal-that-ensures-apple-supply-apart-from-china]\n \t* Hearing, sleep apnea features for AirPods, Apple Watch available in Asia [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467599-hearing-sleep-apnea-features-airpods-apple-watch-available-asia]\n\n ",

          "content": "A startup created by Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)) is stepping into the broadband spotlight as it goes after a share of the federal government's $42.5 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. The company, Taara, says in a blog post that its wireless Lightbridge technology can beam high-speed internet over the air, offering an alternative to both fiber and satellite options.\n\nTaara has stated on X that it is “BEAD-ready,” referencing the initiative backed by the U.S. government. The post followed a major revision to the BEAD rules by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced in early June, which now encourages technology neutrality rather than prioritizing traditional gigabit fiber. That change gives companies like Taara a chance to compete directly with Elon Musk's Starlink and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) 5G Home Internet for funding.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the announcement that the revised BEAD guidelines reflect a shift toward technology neutrality, aiming to deliver high-speed internet more efficiently and cost-effectively without prioritizing any single approach.\n\nAlphabet's Taara Targets the Broadband Dead Zone Starlink Can't Reach\n\nTaara is led by Mahesh Krishnaswamy, a former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google engineer who spun the project out of Alphabet's X moonshot factory after working on its earlier initiative, Loon. He has been focused on bridging global connectivity gaps since his early days in Chennai, India. \"Today, there are like 3 billion people still unconnected, and there is a dire need to bring them online,\" Krishnaswamy told Wired. His mission, he says, is to find scalable ways to bring high-speed internet to the places the fiber can't reach.\n\nRather than laying cable underground or relying on orbiting satellites, Taara says it uses devices installed on towers to send internet signals through the air across distances of up to 20 kilometers. The company positions this technology as a solution to the \"middle mile\" infrastructure gap, which connects the main internet backbone to local delivery systems like fiber or 5G towers.\n\nTrending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share\n\nAccording to Taara, this part of the network is especially crucial in remote and challenging environments, where last-mile connections often remain isolated without an efficient link to the larger grid. \"Without it, even the last-mile fiber connections or 5G cell towers remain stranded, unable to reach the broader internet,\" the company wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet’s GFiber says Taara’s Lightbridge can deliver speeds of up to 20 Gbps with ultra-low latency and no packet loss under clear weather conditions. This was demonstrated during a test in San Francisco with GFiber, which reported performance that matched high-end wired networks and exceeded traditional wireless radio systems.\n\nSee Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25\n\nDigicomm Deal Signals Taara's Play for Scaled, High-Speed Wireless Internet\n\nIn May, Taara partnered with Digicomm International, a major telecom equipment supplier, to help deploy its Lightbridge system at scale. Digicomm announced that it will deliver Taara’s Lightbridge to broadband providers, businesses, and municipalities seeking fast, high-capacity wireless internet.\n\nWired describes Taara as a high-speed, earthbound alternative to Starlink, one that's already shown success at events like Coachella and in cities where laying fiber is cost-prohibitive. Whether the federal government will see Lightbridge as a worthy investment remains to be seen, but Alphabet is clearly placing a bet on the future of middle-mile infrastructure.\n\nRead Next: Are you rich?

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he was likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month and that levies on semiconductors could come soon as well, suggesting that those import taxes could hit alongside broad “reciprocal” rates set for implementation on Aug. 1.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\n“Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff,” Trump told reporters Tuesday as he returned to Washington after attending an artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh.\n\nTrump also said his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors was “similar” and that it was “less complicated” to impose levies on chips, without providing additional detail.\n\nAt a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said he planned to impose a 50% tariff on copper in the coming weeks, and that he expected pharmaceutical tariffs to grow as high as 200% after giving companies a year to bring manufacturing back to the US. Trump has already announced investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on drugs, arguing a flood of foreign imports was threatening national security.\n\nStill, any tariffs could immediately impact drugmakers like Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. that produce drugs overseas — and risks driving up costs for US consumers. So does Trump’s plans for semiconductor tariffs, which are expected to hit not only the chips themselves but popular products like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronic Co. laptops and smartphones.\n\nThe threat came as Trump in recent days has sent letters to a number of trading partners unilaterally dictating the rates for tariffs on many imports — while maintaining he would continue to carry out negotiations. Earlier Tuesday, Trump announced an agreement with Indonesia reducing the 32% rate announced in one of the letters to 19%. Indonesia agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets as part of the agreement, the US said.\n\nTrump on Tuesday predicted that he could strike “two or three” trade deals with countries before implementing his so-called reciprocal tariffs before they are implemented on Aug. 1, saying that an agreement with India was among the most likely.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump told reporters the US was engaged in substantive discussions with between five and six countries, but that he wasn’t necessarily inclined to finalize agreements over simply dictating a tariff rate.\n\n“I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” Trump said.\n\nThe president also said that he was likely to impose a standard tariff of “probably a little over 10%” on smaller countries that did not receive tailored rates.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump said representatives from the European Union — which faces a 30% tariff — would be meeting with US negotiators this week. After returning from Pittsburgh, Trump said that while some countries had indicated a willingness to “open” trade after his threats — including South Korea — others, like Japan, had not.\n\nTrump also dismissed concerns that his threat earlier in the week to impose “secondary” tariffs on Russian trading partners if Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine could impact US consumers, even as experts warned the president risked driving up energy costs with his plan.\n\n“I don’t think so. I think that whole thing is going to go away,” Trump said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget DOGE.

          "title": "Stocks Fade as Expectations are Trimmed for Fed Rate Cut in September",
          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Tuesday closed down -0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.98%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.13%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.50%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) were unchanged.\n\nStock indexes rallied early Tuesday due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +5 bp, and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks.

stocks showing declines, led by American Express (AXP), Home Depot (HD), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Merck (MRK).\n\nTuesday's CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was partly driven by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs in the CPI report of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May's +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May's +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12.\" Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is \"all part of a mosaic\" in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nThere was also some positive trade news after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, US imports from Indonesia, totaling around $2.8 billion, will face a US tariff of 19%, which is likely to raise the price that US consumers pay for Indonesian goods.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent negative US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.  Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nTuesday's July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June's level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD) fell -3% Tuesday after the House failed to approve a procedural vote to begin consideration of three bills backed by the crypto industry.  Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which may promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets during the remainder of this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May. Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports on Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday closed mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.31%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Tuesday fell -14.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +5.2 bp to 4.485%.  T-note prices were undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 58% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate rose to a 4.75-month high and ended the day up +1.0 bp at 2.414%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued Tuesday, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed's independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Fed Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition. Mr. Powell's term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May 2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell's term ends in May 2026, or earlier, \"for cause,\" based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed's building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.712%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.5 bp to 4.625%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks generally closed higher on Tuesday, except for Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA), which closed more than -1% lower.  Apple (AAPL) closed slightly higher after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp.\n\nIn Tesla (TSLA) news, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla's top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks showed some strength Tuesday, and helped keep the Nasdaq 100 index in positive territory, after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than +4%.  Arm Holdings (ARM) rose more than +2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed lower on Tuesday as bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -3% on the failure of the House to approve a procedural vote to consider crypto-friendly bills.  Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell more than -3%, and Mara Holdings (MARA) fell by more than -2%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell -1.9%, and Coinbase (COIN) fell -1.5%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) fell by more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell -0.7% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners traded lower after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) fell -3%, and Southern Copper (SCCO) fell -2.4%.\n\nEarnings Reports (7/16/2025)\n\nPrologis Inc (PLD), Progressive Corp/The (PGR), M&T Bank Corp (MTB), PNC Financial Services Group I (PNC), Bank of America Corp (BAC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Goldman Sachs Group

          "content": "STORY: U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow dropping about one percent, the S&P 500 shedding four-tenths of a percent, but the Nasdaq ticked up nearly two-tenths of a percent.\n\nIt was the fourth session out of five that the technology-heavy Nasdaq posted a record close.\n\nAI-chip leader Nvidia was the primary factor. Its shares jumped 4% after the company unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China, explained Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance.\n\n\"As we know, Nvidia is the highest-valued stock in the market in the world, north of $4 trillion. So, when Nvidia moves sharply higher, which it is today, that in and of itself can move the Nasdaq. But Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, which are now over 500, those tech stocks are back in control for sure, and that is what's moving the market today.\"\n\nThe news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer gaining nearly six-and-a-half and seven percent, respectively.

          "title": "Apple's $500M MP Materials deal, Cook's leadership amid AI race",
          "content": "Apple (AAPL) is in focus after announcing a $500 million deal to buy rare earth magnets from MP Materials (MP) as investors weigh CEO Tim Cook's role as the iPhone maker lags its Big Tech peers in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nCreative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin sits down with Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to take a closer look at the latest from Apple.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nApple saying say it's going to invest $500 million into MP materials as a long-time apple watcher. You saw that and thought what?\n\n00:09 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I think it's it makes a lot of sense, right? Apple has taken every opportunity through the history of this company dating back to even you know the iPod where they've built, uh, bought storage and memory up in bulk again because memory prices of those things can fluctuate. So I think anytime that you can come in and buy in bulk something that gives you a fixed price that you know you can control that pricing for yourselves going forward, um, they're going to make that investment every time, right? In this term, right, whatever rare earths they need in order to manufacture, right, whether that's parts of product or batteries or whatever that is. Those are the things that they'll secure up if they can, and it makes a lot of sense because again, in supply chain management and being able to keep costs down, that's a very strategic move.\n\n00:52 Speaker A\n\nLet's stick with Cook. You saw how those analysts made some waves put out a note provocative at least and maybe it's time for a change in the C suite. What did you make of that?\n\n01:00 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I mean, I think the sentiment is really just coming from, you know, wanting to see more modern leaders or people who are coming up through the ranks that haven't been there or might bring a fresh take to the business. And I think again, right, the reality is if there was somebody better, like if Tim Cook or others thought that there was somebody better within Apple to run and move this company forward, I think they would make that change. Like I don't think this is a matter of pride or um, you know, or stubbornness. I think this is he's still the right guy. The investors believe he's the right guy. The board believes the right guy. And in fact, I believe a lot of the executives believe that he's the right guy. And so I think that's a key part of them keeping him in position. But now this again comes back to a new era of execution, which again, he is now seeing overseeing more of those businesses.\n\n01:44 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, I saw reported he is Cook is staying put on this on the question of Apple and AI Ben. Investors, there are investors who are disappointed with where they're at. You can see that in in the stock and how it's reacted so far this year, we're down about nearly 20%. What do you make of that? How do you think about Apple's role in this AI market right now?\n\n02:07 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I mean, I think one of the best ways to just understand, I think where we're going here is is more not in every one technology or one winner's going to win everything here. You know, I think people like to bucket OpenAI or Google or others and say like these are the ones that are going to win, like this isn't a winner take all market, right? And that's in today's era of just querying right chat GPT or Gemini to do some search. We're moving to an era which is far more agentic, right, which means that you're going to have an agent, that agent is going to work on your behalf, and it's going to understand, you know, you Josh, your preferences, your likes, you're where you're at in the world, your location, like intimate levels of details of you and then go work with other agents, Google's agents, Amazon agents, Meta's agent, etc. So you'll have this one thing and all those agents will have domain expertise. And I think Apple's goal is to have domain expertise again on the customer on their ecosystem. And that's something that they can easily do, right? They don't need to boil the ocean. They can partner with OpenAI or Gemini if you just want to search the internet. But the key is having a smart, intelligent, and intimate agent that knows you that can go and work on your behalf for actions, do predictive things, do things on your behalf. And I think that's their broader strategy, and it's just doing what they can do well, which is create a much more agent or much more friendly customer experience when it comes to AI.\n\n03:27 Speaker A\n\nAnd can they get this done in house in Cupertino Ben? Or and I ask you because I've had analysts come on the show and tell me, it is time for Apple to bring out the checkbook. They're going to have to make a big deal, a big AI deal. I had one analyst tell me it should be perplexity. Um, that would you know, historically Apple Apple does deals, but they're they're smaller. I think the biggest one they ever had was biggest ever was beats for three billion. Um, what do you make of that line of questioning?\n\n04:02 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, I'd say there's two things, right? Apple always doesn't just look at technology, they look at culture. Is this a cultural fit? So that's also a question you've got to ask is who could they buy that fits into the broader culture of Apple. But I think, you know, again, I like Perplexity. I use Perplexity. They're a little bit of a different company. You still need a big foundational model even if you're using perplexity. So that doesn't entirely solve Apple's problems. I think there's actually some smaller acquisitions that can be made. You know, you pointed out Mark German actually said that Mistral is being looked at, which is a large foundational model. I think that would make a ton of sense. And there really are a lot of startups coming out of the valley doing really interesting things, and some of those teams and those individuals in their technology might be a better fit for Apple. But again, I think they don't necessarily need this big world internet foundational model. I think if they've got this agent that's got domain expertise, and that's about their ecosystem, their software, you the customer, and your preferences, and that agent can go work with other agents, which is how the world we're moving to an agentic AI. I think they have everything they need to do on that vision. The question is do they want to do more than that?

Flock - Apple Privacy\n\n\"Severance\"\n\nIn \"Severance,\" Mark Scout (Adam Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in \"work-life balance\" is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. In season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\n\n\"The Studio\"\n\nIn \"The Studio,\" Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.\n\n\"Shrinking\"\n\n\"Shrinking\" follows a grieving therapist who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks. Ignoring his training and ethics, he finds himself making huge, tumultuous changes to people’s lives … including his own.\n\n\"Slow Horses\"\n\nThis darkly funny espionage drama follows a team of British intelligence agents who serve in a dumping ground department of MI5 due to their career-ending mistakes. Led by their brilliant but irascible leader, the notorious Jackson Lamb (Academy Award winner Sir Gary Oldman), they navigate the espionage world’s smoke and mirrors to defend England from sinister forces.\n\n\"Presumed Innocent\"\n\n\"Presumed Innocent\" is an eight-episode limited series starring and executive produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, hailing from David E. Kelley and executive producer J.J. Abrams and based on the New York Times bestselling novel of the same name by Scott Turow. Starring Gyllenhaal in the lead role of chief deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich, the series takes viewers on a gripping journey through the horrific murder that upends the Chicago Prosecuting Attorney’s office when one of its own is suspected of the crime. The series explores obsession, sex, politics, and the power and limits of love, as the accused fights to hold his family and marriage together. The star-studded ensemble cast of the thriller also includes Ruth Negga, Bill Camp, Elizabeth Marvel, Peter Sarsgaard, O-T Fagbenle and Renate Reinsve.\n\n\"Disclaimer\"\n\n\"Disclaimer\" is a gripping psychological thriller in seven chapters, starring Academy Award winners Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline. Written and directed by five-time Academy Award winner Alfonso Cuarón, \"Disclaimer\" is based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Renée Knight. Acclaimed journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) built her reputation revealing the misdeeds and transgressions of others. When she receives a novel from an unknown author, she is horrified to realize she is now the main character in a story that exposes her darkest secrets.\n\nAs Catherine races to uncover the writer’s true identity, she is forced to confront her past before it destroys her life and her relationships with her husband Robert (Sacha Baron Cohen) and their son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The ensemble cast includes Lesley Manville, Louis Partridge, Leila George and Hoyeon, and features Indira Varma as the narrator.\n\n\"Bad Sisters\"\n\n\"Bad Sisters\" season two returns to follow the lives of the Garvey sisters played by Sharon Horgan as Eva, Anne-Marie Duff as Grace, Eva Birthistle as Ursula, Sarah Greene as Bibi and Eve Hewson as Becka. Two years after the \"accidental death\" of Grace’s abusive husband, the close-knit Garvey sisters may have moved on, but when past truths resurface, the ladies are thrust back into the spotlight, suspicions are at an all-time high, lies are told, secrets revealed and the sisters are forced to work out who they can trust.\n\n\"Dope Thief\"\n\nBased on Dennis Tafoya’s book \"Dope Thief,\" the series follows long-time Philly friends and delinquents who pose as DEA agents to rob an unknown house in the countryside, only to have their small-time grift become a life-and-death enterprise, as they unwittingly reveal and unravel the biggest hidden narcotics corridor on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\"The Gorge\"\n\nTwo highly-trained operatives (Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts in guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within. They bond from a distance while trying to stay vigilant in defending against an unseen enemy. When the cataclysmic threat to humanity is revealed to them, they must work together in a test of both their physical and mental strength to keep the secret in the gorge before it’s too late.\n\n\"Pachinko\"\n\nEpic in scope and intimate in tone, the story begins with a forbidden love and crescendos into a sweeping saga that journeys between Korea, Japan and America to tell an unforgettable story of war and peace, love and loss, triumph and reckoning.\n\n\"Your Friends & Neighbors\"\n\nAfter being fired in disgrace, a hedge fund manager still grappling with his recent divorce, resorts to stealing from his neighbors’ homes in the exceedingly affluent Westmont Village, only to discover that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined.\n\n\"Deaf President Now!\"\n\nThe story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of. \"Deaf President Now!\" recounts the eight days of historic protests held at Gallaudet University in 1988 after the school’s board of trustees appointed a hearing president over several very qualified Deaf candidates. After a week of rallies, boycotts and protests, the students of Gallaudet University triumph as the hearing president resigns and beloved dean Dr. I. King Jordan becomes the university’s first Deaf president. The protests marked a pivotal moment in civil rights history, with an impact that extended well beyond the Gallaudet campus, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \"Deaf President Now!\" features exclusive interviews with the five key figures of the movement, including the DPN4 — Jerry Covell, Bridgetta Bourne-Firl, Tim Rarus and Greg Hlibok — alongside I. King Jordan, as well as archival and scripted elements. The film also incorporates an experimental narrative approach called Deaf Point of View, using impressionistic visual photography and intricate sound design to thrust the audience into the Deaf experience.\n\n\"Bono: Stories of Surrender\"\n\n\"Bono: Stories of Surrender\" is a vivid reimagining of Bono’s critically acclaimed one-man stage show, \"Stories of Surrender: An Evening of Words, Music and Some Mischief…\" As he pulls back the curtain on a remarkable life and the family, friends and faith that have challenged and sustained him, he also reveals personal stories about his journey as a son, father, husband, activist and rock star. Along with never-before-seen, exclusive footage from the tour, the film features Bono performing many of the iconic U2 songs that have shaped his life and legacy.\n\n\"Dark Matter\"\n\nHailed as one of the best sci-fi novels of the decade, \"Dark Matter\" is a story about the road not taken. The series will follow Jason Dessen (played by Joel Edgerton), a physicist, professor and family man who — one night while walking home on the streets of Chicago — is abducted into an alternate version of his life. Wonder quickly turns to nightmare when he tries to return to his reality amid the mind-bending landscape of lives he could have lived. In this labyrinth of realities, he embarks on a harrowing journey to get back to his true family and save them from the most terrifying, unbeatable foe imaginable: himself.\n\nAll programs are currently streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nApple TV+ offers premium, compelling drama and comedy series, feature films, groundbreaking documentaries, and kids and family entertainment, and is available to watch across all your favorite screens.

          "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the nation’s auto safety regulator will argue on Wednesday that the agency must actively oversee self-driving vehicle technology, a potential sign of a tougher approach than some critics expected.\n\nJonathan Morrison, chief counsel of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the first Trump administration, will testify to the U.S. Senate that autonomous vehicles offer potential benefits but also unique risks.\n\n\"NHTSA cannot sit back and wait for problems to arise with such developing technologies, but must demonstrate strong leadership,\" Morrison said in written testimony seen by Reuters.\n\nThe comments suggested NHTSA will continue to closely scrutinize self-driving vehicles. Some critics of the technology had expressed alarm over NHTSA staff cuts this year under a cost-cutting campaign led by Elon Musk, who was a close adviser to Trump and is CEO of self-driving automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe Musk-Trump alliance prompted some critics to speculate that NHTSA would go easy on self-driving vehicle developers. But the relationship began to unravel in late May over Trump’s spending plans, and the two are now locked in a feud.\n\nNHTSA said last month it was seeking information from Tesla about social media videos of robotaxis and self-driving cars Tesla was testing in Austin, Texas. The videos were alleged to show one of the vehicles using the wrong lane and another speeding.\n\nSince October, NHTSA has been investigating 2.4 million Tesla vehicles with full self-driving technology after four reported collisions, including a 2023 fatal crash.\n\n\"The technical and policy challenges surrounding\n\nthese new technologies must be addressed,\" Morrison’s testimony said. \"Failure to do so will result in products that the public\n\nwill not accept and the agency will not tolerate.\"\n\nOther companies in the self-driving sector also were subjects of NHTSA investigations including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Waymo, which last year faced reports its robotaxis may have broken traffic laws. Waymo in May recalled 1,200 self-driving vehicles, and the probe remains open.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny increased after 2023 when a pedestrian was seriously injured by a GM Cruise self-driving car.\n\nThe first recorded death of a pedestrian related to self-driving technology was in 2018 in Tempe, Arizona.",

          "title": "Stocks Fade as Expectations are Trimmed for Fed Rate Cut in September",
          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) on Tuesday closed down -0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview]) (DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) closed down -0.98%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) closed up +0.13%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) fell -0.50%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) were unchanged. \n\nStock indexes rallied early Tuesday due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +5 bp, and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks. \n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was undercut by negative breadth with 26 of the 30 stocks showing declines, led by American Express (AXP [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AXP/overview]), Home Depot (HD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HD/overview]), UnitedHealth (UNH [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UNH/overview]), and Merck (MRK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRK/overview]).\n\nTuesday's CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was partly driven by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs in the CPI report of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May's +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May's +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12.\" Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is \"all part of a mosaic\" in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nThere was also some positive trade news after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, US imports from Indonesia, totaling around $2.8 billion, will face a US tariff of 19%, which is likely to raise the price that US consumers pay for Indonesian goods. \n\nStocks have been undercut by recent negative US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.  Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nTuesday's July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June's level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) fell -3% Tuesday after the House failed to approve a procedural vote to begin consideration of three bills backed by the crypto industry.  Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which may promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets during the remainder of this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May. Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports on Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research. \n\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday closed mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.31%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) on Tuesday fell -14.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +5.2 bp to 4.485%.  T-note prices were undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 58% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate rose to a 4.75-month high and ended the day up +1.0 bp at 2.414%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued Tuesday, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed's independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Fed Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition. Mr. Powell's term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May 2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell's term ends in May 2026, or earlier, \"for cause,\" based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed's building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.712%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.5 bp to 4.625%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks generally closed higher on Tuesday, except for Meta Platforms (META [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/META/overview]) and Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]), which closed more than -1% lower.  Apple (AAPL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/overview]) closed slightly higher after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp. \n\nIn Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]) news, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla's top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks showed some strength Tuesday, and helped keep the Nasdaq 100 index in positive territory, after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMD/overview]) rose more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NVDA/overview]) rose more than +4%.  Arm Holdings (ARM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ARM/overview]) rose more than +2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed lower on Tuesday as bitcoin (^BTCUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) fell -3% on the failure of the House to approve a procedural vote to consider crypto-friendly bills.  Riot Platforms (RIOT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/RIOT/overview]) fell more than -3%, and Mara Holdings (MARA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MARA/overview]) fell by more than -2%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MSTR/overview]) fell -1.9%, and Coinbase (COIN [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/COIN/overview]) fell -1.5%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BLK/overview]) fell by more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations. \n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/JPM/overview]) fell -0.7% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners traded lower after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products. Freeport McMoRan (FCX [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/FCX/overview]) fell -3%, and Southern Copper (SCCO [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SCCO/overview]) fell -2.4%. \n\nEARNINGS REPORTS (7/16/2025)\n\nPrologis Inc (PLD), Progressive Corp/The (PGR), M&T Bank Corp (MTB), PNC Financial

          "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on ASML Holding on FluentInQuality's Substack. As of 14ᵗʰ July, ASML Holding's share was trading at $806.73. ASML's trailing and forward P/E were 31.15 and 30.21 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.Jim Cramer Notes ASML Holding (ASML)'s \"Last Couple Quarters Have Been Weak\"\n\nA technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines.\n\nASML is not a chipmaker; it builds the machines that make the most advanced chips possible, forming the invisible foundation of modern computing. It monopolizes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the cutting-edge process essential for fabricating next-gen semiconductors. No company can match ASML’s precision, which operates at a nanoscopic scale using 13.5nm light, space-grade ZEISS mirrors, and billionth-of-a-meter alignment. With zero real competitors, ASML stands as a gatekeeper to the global chip supply chain, enabling products from NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, Intel, and TSMC. Without ASML, advanced chips—and by extension AI, data centers, and national defense infrastructure—cannot be built.\n\nIts EUV tools sell for over $200 million each, but due to limited supply and overwhelming demand, ASML allocates rather than sells, maintaining a multi-year backlog. The firm’s moat is fortified by thousands of patents, irreplaceable suppliers, and two decades of lead time, making it effectively impossible to replicate even with unlimited capital. While capital intensive, ASML is extremely capital efficient, boasting near-50% gross margins, industry-leading returns, and consistent free cash flow that funds buybacks and dividends.\n\nEach new lithography node increases ASPs and deepens customer lock-in. As chips become more complex, demand for ASML’s precision rises—cementing it as a growing bottleneck in an increasingly consolidated industry. Its next leap, High NA EUV, is already underway. As the only Western firm producing such advanced lithography, ASML is also a geopolitical asset—banned in China, protected by allies. It doesn’t chase trends like AI or edge computing; it enables them. ASML is a fortress built on physics.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on ASML Holding N.V. by Monopolistic Investor in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in EUV lithography, disciplined pricing strategy, and strong government backing. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 8.06% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. Monopolistic Investor shares an identical view but emphasizes ASML’s geopolitical and technological indispensability.\n\nASML Holding is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 80 hedge fund portfolios held ASML at the end of first quarter which was 86 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

          "title": "The attacks on Tim Cook are half-baked—despite Apple stumbling over AI",
          "content": "Apple received an unwanted spotlight last week when President Trump’s trade advisor, Peter Navarro, attacked CEO Tim Cook for not moving manufacturing out of China fast enough. In fact, having received similar pressure during Trump’s first term, Apple, in terms of what it sells in the U.S., now makes most iPhones in India and most laptops, AirPods, and other devices in Vietnam. Furthermore, Cook has committed over $500 billion to new U.S. manufacturing facilities and design centers that will employ about 20,000 Americans.\n\nNevertheless, by late last week attention had quickly shifted to Cook’s tenure as CEO.\n\nPart of this may be seasonal. There is often debate during the hot midsummer months—after annual shareholder meetings—over whether CEO is turnover increasing or decreasing. CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla has said that one factor behind this is an effort to create headlines during the “tape slump” of major business news. He suggested this behavior was behind a recent report by respected analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone at Lightshed calling for Apple to consider replacing Cook amidst Apple’s struggles with artificial intelligence.\n\nWe believe that such short-sighted attacks on an icon of American industry could not be more misguided. Cook’s leadership is still critically needed at Apple.\n\nApple and AI\n\nWhile Apple hasn’t been a first mover in AI, it doesn’t need to be. In fact, it might benefit the company to not get sucked into the AI arms race amidst counterproductive and desperate moves from competitors—consider Meta offering cash bonuses of up to $100 million to poach AI engineers from rivals.\n\nAt our Yale CEO Summit last month, nearly 50% of CEOs polled believe that AI hype has already led to significant overinvestment within their companies. An equal proportion think that AI investments have been allocated inefficiently and profess disappointment with the return on investment.\n\nWhile nobody doubts the importance of AI to Apple’s future, a critical management skill is finding the right balance on the make vs. buy tradeoff. Developing products in-house is not the only way to go. Despite Apple’s setbacks with Apple Intelligence, a potential partnership or outright acquisition of Perplexity could transform Apple into an AI leader practically overnight, as noted by many savvy analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives.\n\nThere are many examples of companies successfully buying or partnering their way into new products or business lines: IBM’s visionary acquisition of RedHat in 2019 gave it a foothold in cloud computing—now a core business. Pfizer’s partnership with BioNTech during the pandemic allowed for the rapid production of the COVID vaccine. Merck’s acquisition of Schering-Plough brought in the blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, which now powers about half of its sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTransforming Apple\n\nDespite Apple’s AI stumbles, Cook deserves a long leash as one of the most revered chief executives of our time, with an unparalleled track record of accomplishment. A genuine tech visionary, he faced the daunting and unenviable task of succeeding the larger-than-life Steve Jobs. He assumed the reins with a rare blend of energy and humility, inspiring others to innovate without any personal grandiosity, transforming Apple into the world’s most valuable company.\n\nUnder Cook’s stewardship, Apple’s market value has soared from $350 billion in 2011 to more than $3 trillion today. Apple became the first U.S. company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2018, doubling that figure in 2020 and tripling it just three years later.\n\nDespite the echo-chamber accusations that Cook is nothing more than a supply chain guru and not a true product visionary, the truth is that Cook’s tenure has seen Apple revolutionize its product lineup, driving profound advancements for the iPhone, Mac, and iPad and introducing industry-leading devices such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple Vision Pro. His leadership has also expanded the Apple ecosystem, launching services like Apple Pay, which is growing every year, as well as Apple Music and Apple TV+.\n\nDespite this unparalleled record of achievement, even supporters of Cook wonder if he may have lost his touch or his creativity. Though strongly supporting Cook, CNBC anchor David Faber wondered aloud, “sometimes, as people get older, they may not be taking in as much information, or their expertise may be in an area that is no longer as specific to needs of their business, and I’m curious as to whether there is somebody else out there who might be in a better position to do that.”\n\nLong leadership\n\nThe first author of this essay has closely studied age and work—once called industrial gerontology—since the founding of the field decades ago, and my bookThe Hero’s Farewell: What Happens when CEOs Retire provided the first empirical studies of leaders in late career. There is no correspondence between age and invention, or age and leadership.\n\nOver 45 years of research on age and work, I have closely documented the effects of age and found potentially surprising results. Older workers tend to have greater sales skills and interpersonal savvy, with only modest declines in physical dexterity. Research on age and risk in engineering found that older managers were only mildly less willing to take risks. They took longer to make decisions, but they were better able to appreciate the value of new information.\n\nConsider some of the startling examples through history. Benjamin Franklin helped draft the Declaration of Independence at 70, invented bifocal glasses in his late 70s, and negotiated an agreement to salvage the Constitutional Convention at 81. France relied upon Charles De Gaulle to unify the nation while he was in his late sixties and seventies. Averell Harriman, after leading Union Pacific and Brown Brothers Harriman, served as one of America’s greatest diplomats, unofficially advising presidents until his nineties.\n\nCompared to these examples, at age 64, Cook is just getting started.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some steps Cook can take to strengthen Apple’s positioning, even beyond doubling down on AI development. As CNBC’s Jim Cramer pointed out, it would not hurt with the Trump administration if Apple accelerated some of its $500 billion commitment for domestic manufacturing. Moving some spending forward and accelerating that planned four-year timeline would be a tangible political and patriotic signal to rectify Trump’s fears that he is being played via delays and long timeframes. Similarly, it may not hurt Apple to add a respected technologist with AI, software, or hardware expertise to its board.\n\nBut clearly, Apple has stayed ripe for growth and product innovation under Cook, and the attacks on him and the company are half-baked.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nRead more:\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has created more shareholder value than Steve Jobs.

          "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just made a $500 million move that could reshape the rare-earth supply chainand investors are taking notice of MP Materials (NYSE:MP). Under a new multiyear deal, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will source U.S.-made rare-earth magnets from MP starting in 2027, as part of its broader strategy to reduce reliance on China. These magnets are key components inside iPhones and other devicespowering things like the haptic engine and internal microphones. MP will produce the magnets in Texas, using recycled materials processed at a new California facility, both part of a vertically integrated supply chain that Apple hopes can withstand future geopolitical shocks.\n\nFor context, China has long dominated global rare-earth magnet production. But that dominance has come under pressure, especially after Beijing imposed export controls last spring in response to U.S. tariffs. That move caused a scramble among Western manufacturers and led to supply chain reevaluations across the tech industry. Apple, already under political pressure from former President Trump to bring more of its operations back to the U.S., appears to be responding with more tangible stepsstarting with this agreement. According to MP's SEC filing, Apple will make a $200 million prepayment, a rare move that signals commitment from both sides.\n\nThis shift also aligns with Apple's previously announced plan to spend $500 billion in the U.S. over four years. While analysts at Bank of America suggest much of that was already planned, the MP deal suggests Apple could be reallocating spending from other regions into strategic domestic capacity. Though the company continues expanding in India and Vietnam, this magnet supply agreement may signal that Apple sees long-term risk in depending on China for mission-critical inputs. And for MP, this could be a breakout momentcementing its role as a key supplier for one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "Leading emergency information app Watch Duty uses Mapbox to provide critical up-to-date wildfire and emergency information to millions of users across 22 states.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, July 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mapbox announces an expansion of its partnership with Watch Duty, the nonprofit wildfire alert system used by millions of people across the U.S. to stay safe during wildfire emergencies. Built on the Mapbox location platform, Watch Duty has been recognized as one of TIME's Most Influential Companies of 2025, one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies of 2025, and the winner of the 2025 Apple Design Award for Social Impact.Mapbox Logo (PRNewsfoto/Mapbox)\n\n\"We love Watch Duty's mission and are happy to see so many others also recognizing its great contribution to the safety of those impacted by wildfires. Its success also affirms how organizations of any size — from volunteer-led nonprofits to global enterprises — can build mission-critical, scalable applications using Mapbox,\" said Cherie Wong, SVP of Location Services at Mapbox.\n\nDelivering Clarity When It Matters Most Watch Duty provides live wildfire incident updates through a dynamic, map-based app built with Mapbox GL JS, Mapbox map tiles, and custom map styling. Watch Duty makes thousands of updates per day during wildfire season, and Mapbox ensures that this highly dynamic content is delivered with exceptional geospatial context and precision. When every second counts and precise location awareness matters, Mapbox equips Watch Duty to reach users with actionable information using maps optimized for speed, clarity, and accessibility.\n\n\"Our mission is to serve everyone, including people who might be unfamiliar with using maps, with clear and up-to-date location information during emergencies,\" said John Mills, CEO of Watch Duty. \"Mapbox gives us the tools to build fast, intuitive maps that just work — even when usage spikes and the stakes are high.\"\n\nThe Critical Importance of Clear, Customized Map Design Initially built with open-source tools, Watch Duty switched to Mapbox basemaps and geocoding for its superior performance and design flexibility. Mapbox excels at satisfying highly specific design requirements, even the finer details such as using the correct, locally-recognized road shield icons across different states so that users can easily recognize roads when interpreting the map and planning evacuation routes.\n\n\"Doing things like getting the highway interstate signs right was impossible on our earliest versions built with Esri, Leaflet, and OpenStreetMap. With Mapbox, we can customize our map design however we need to,\" said Mills. \"Watch Duty is all about user experience, because during a disaster, our map has to be easy to use. Mapbox is the only map provider that seems to get this.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nMapbox also provides unmatched control over the order, styling, and visibility of map layers — giving Watch Duty the ability to preserve map legibility even while displaying numerous overlapping layers showing evacuation zones, fire perimeters, power outages, red flag weather warnings, and more. Using the Mapbox Studio map styling interface, the Watch Duty engineers can more efficiently collaborate with designers to fine-tune the basemap styling.\n\n\"The map style editor in Mapbox Studio is an incredible tool,\" said Dave Merritt, CTO of Watch Duty. \"Watch Duty has so many map layers, the overall visual clarity of our map styles is essential. Mapbox Studio allows for a lot more design exploration and ultimately a much more usable and accessible product, which are key tenets for Watch Duty.\"\n\nFrom Maplibre to Mapbox: Performance That Scales After encountering challenges with adding features and fixing bugs when using the open source mapping software Maplibre, Watch Duty migrated to the latest version of Mapbox GL JS, using Capacitor to serve the app on both web and mobile platforms. Building with the Mapbox map renderer has improved map performance and enables easier maintenance and feature development for the Watch Duty engineers.\n\n\"Watch Duty migrated from Maplibre GL to Mapbox GL JS because we needed a more usable, robust mapping platform,\" said Merritt. \"Our migration was fast, and the performance gains have been immediate.\"\n\nThe expanded partnership between Mapbox and Watch Duty includes ongoing collaboration to further enhance the performance and design of Watch Duty's maps based on continued feedback from public and first responders.\n\nBuilding for Unpredictable Demand with a Predictable Partner Watch Duty experiences rapid, large-scale usage surges during wildfire events. Ensuring reliable performance during spikes is a challenge for any application and developer team, but especially critical during emergencies. The Mapbox platform provides the reliability that Watch Duty requires to be able to serve millions of requests per second.\n\n\"Free open source software alone would never be enough to do what we're doing, at the level of demand that we serve,\" said Mills. \"Having a technology partner like Mapbox means that we are able to scale with confidence and keep providing this critical service to the public.\"\n\nThe partnership ensures that Watch Duty can continue offering the best map experience to its users. It also engages the geospatial engineering expertise of Mapbox developers to rapidly resolve issues and co-develop valuable new features to support emergency response and wildfire safety.\n\n\"Watch Duty has an incredible attention to detail and they raise the bar on the life-saving assistance they provide to so many communities across the US. The Mapbox team is excited to partner with their innovative team,\" said Wong. \"Mapbox product teams and engineers drive geospatial innovation for our customers every day, but it is a special honor to support an application that helps to keep so many people safe.\"\n\nAbout Watch Duty Watch Duty is a nonprofit organization that delivers real-time emergency information to the public. Powered by a network of volunteers, firefighters, dispatchers, and technologists, its mission is to ensure that communities receive accurate and timely emergency information about wildfires through alerts when they need it most.

          "content": "Rivian (RIVN) is tightening its relationship with Google (GOOG, GOOGL), leaving Apple (AAPL) and CarPlay out in the cold.\n\nRivian said today that it is incorporating Google Maps natively into its infotainment system, meaning Google routing, time of arrival, traffic, and satellite imagery will be \"seamlessly integrated\" into Rivian's navigation system.\n\nUsing Google's Automotive SDK for Maps, Rivian can build its own custom navigation system on top of Google Maps. This will give drivers the freshest mapping and traffic data, along with updated ETA info and \"arrival range\" at destination, a critical piece of information for users, directly within Rivian navigation.\n\nCharging information, such as where to stop, user preferences, and the location's overall score, will be included, as well as locations for the bespoke Rivian Charging Network.Rivian says its drivers will now have \"industry-leading routing, estimated time of arrivals, traffic updates, place information, and satellite imagery from Google Maps — all seamlessly integrated into Rivian's navigation system.\" (Rivian)·Rivian\n\nThe addition of Google Maps is welcome news for Rivian owners, with one owner saying the prior system \"always\" suggested longer routes compared to Google Maps, for example.\n\nRivian's embrace of Google Maps comes as other manufacturers like GM (GM) push ahead with deeper integration of Google products. GM's EVs, for example, no longer have Apple CarPlay compatibility, though its gas-powered vehicles do.\n\nThis has been a huge issue for customers who have come to live with CarPlay as the de facto standard for car connectivity. Apple says more than 800 vehicles globally support CarPlay; Apple has also said in the past that 79% of new car buyers insist that the vehicle is CarPlay compliant.\n\nRead more: How to find the best luxury car insuranceCharging information, such as where to stop, user preferences, and the location's overall score, will be included, as well as locations for the bespoke Rivian Charging Network. (Rivian)·Rivian\n\nA third-party McKinsey study found that the percentage is closer to roughly a third of buyers insisting on CarPlay, but nonetheless, consumers are making their preferences heard.\n\n\"Like most corporate decisions, this one is driven by revenue in the hyper-subscription world we now occupy,\" industry analyst Karl Brauer of ISeeCars.com told Yahoo Finance back when GM ditched CarPlay for its EVs.\n\nBy keeping Apple out, GM can charge users for services offered through its native UI systems, like the automaker's SuperCruise semiautonomous software. Tesla has been offering subscription services for years now, with \"enhanced connectivity\" for some features and subscription pricing for its full self-driving (FSD).\n\nRead more: 6 steps to find cheap car insurance in 2025Apple's next-gen CarPlay Ultra displayed in an Aston Martin vehicle.·Apple\n\nGM would also prefer to keep all the data coming from its customers, which it can remarket in a number of ways (but not all), and not have to pay a license fee to Apple for CarPlay.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRivian is likely making the same bet. And as a tech-forward company that makes its own software, Rivian does not want to cede its entire design language and user experience to Apple. However, Rivian does point out that it does include Apple Music, and in the future Apple EnergyKit integration will be coming for home smart charging - but no CarPlay.\n\nRivian owners have been clamoring for CarPlay in forums like Reddit, so a smaller move like Google Maps integration, following Rivian's prior Google inclusions of Search, Cast, and YouTube, for example, may give its owners some of the functionality they desire.\n\nTesla famously does not allow Apple CarPlay or Google's Android projection software in its infotainment system, and never has. Thus far, the lack of CarPlay hasn't hurt Tesla EV sales over the past few years, or at least that hasn't been a cited reason for declining sales in recent quarters.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nPras Subramanian is the lead auto reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "content": "Rivian (RIVN) is tightening its relationship with Google (GOOG, GOOGL), leaving Apple (AAPL) and CarPlay out in the cold.\n\nRivian said today that it is incorporating Google Maps natively into its infotainment system, meaning Google routing, time of arrival, traffic, and satellite imagery will be \"seamlessly integrated\" into Rivian's navigation system.\n\nUsing Google's Automotive SDK for Maps, Rivian can build its own custom navigation system on top of Google Maps. This will give drivers the freshest mapping and traffic data, along with updated ETA info and \"arrival range\" at destination, a critical piece of information for users, directly within Rivian navigation.\n\nCharging information, such as where to stop, user preferences, and the location's overall score, will be included, as well as locations for the bespoke Rivian Charging Network.Rivian says its drivers will now have \"industry-leading routing, estimated time of arrivals, traffic updates, place information, and satellite imagery from Google Maps — all seamlessly integrated into Rivian's navigation system.\" (Rivian)·Rivian\n\nThe addition of Google Maps is welcome news for Rivian owners, with one owner saying the prior system \"always\" suggested longer routes compared to Google Maps, for example.\n\nRivian's embrace of Google Maps comes as other manufacturers like GM (GM) push ahead with deeper integration of Google products. GM's EVs, for example, no longer have Apple CarPlay compatibility, though its gas-powered vehicles do.\n\nThis has been a huge issue for customers who have come to live with CarPlay as the de facto standard for car connectivity. Apple says more than 800 vehicles globally support CarPlay; Apple has also said in the past that 79% of new car buyers insist that the vehicle is CarPlay compliant.\n\nRead more: How to find the best luxury car insuranceCharging information, such as where to stop, user preferences, and the location's overall score, will be included, as well as locations for the bespoke Rivian Charging Network. (Rivian)·Rivian\n\nA third-party McKinsey study found that the percentage is closer to roughly a third of buyers insisting on CarPlay, but nonetheless, consumers are making their preferences heard.\n\n\"Like most corporate decisions, this one is driven by revenue in the hyper-subscription world we now occupy,\" industry analyst Karl Brauer of ISeeCars.com told Yahoo Finance back when GM ditched CarPlay for its EVs.\n\nBy keeping Apple out, GM can charge users for services offered through its native UI systems, like the automaker's SuperCruise semiautonomous software. Tesla has been offering subscription services for years now, with \"enhanced connectivity\" for some features and subscription pricing for its full self-driving (FSD).\n\nRead more: 6 steps to find cheap car insurance in 2025Apple's next-gen CarPlay Ultra displayed in an Aston Martin vehicle.·Apple\n\nGM would also prefer to keep all the data coming from its customers, which it can remarket in a number of ways (but not all), and not have to pay a license fee to Apple for CarPlay.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRivian is likely making the same bet. And as a tech-forward company that makes its own software, Rivian does not want to cede its entire design language and user experience to Apple.\n\nRivian owners have been clamoring for CarPlay in forums like Reddit, so a smaller move like Google Maps integration, following Rivian's prior Google inclusions of Search, Cast, and YouTube, for example, may give its owners some of the functionality they desire.\n\nTesla famously does not allow Apple CarPlay or Google's Android projection software in its infotainment system, and never has. Thus far, the lack of CarPlay hasn't hurt Tesla EV sales over the past few years, or at least that hasn't been a cited reason for declining sales in recent quarters.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nPras Subramanian is the lead auto reporter for Yahoo Finance.

          "title": "Nvidia’s Huang Wins China Reprieve in Rare Trade War Reversal",
          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s Jensen Huang spent months telling everyone what a grave mistake the US was making restricting shipments of artificial intelligence processors to China — with little sign that his argument was swaying anyone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\nThen, very suddenly, that all changed.\n\nLate on Monday, the chipmaker said it received assurances that the US government would allow it to export some chips to the Asian nation. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia’s chief rival, quickly followed with a similar announcement. These export license approvals could generate billions of dollars in total revenue for the companies this year — and they mark a dramatic reversal after the Trump administration said the issue wasn’t even up for debate.\n\nHuang has taken almost every opportunity available to him — from the stage of tech events to Washington visits — to argue that a crackdown on China is counterproductive. During his appearances, he navigated a fine line between praising Trump policies aimed at bringing back chip manufacturing to the US and demanding more freedom to do business in China.\n\nJust last week, Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House.\n\n“Jensen has done a wonderful job at advocating to the administration,” said Matthew Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. The CEO has catered to the White House’s interest in investing in the US, “while at the same time advocating his views on the importance that US AI should flow freely,” he said.\n\nWhen Nvidia announced its plans to reenter the China market, Huang was visiting Beijing, attending a government-sponsored event and meeting officials to discuss “safe and secure AI for the benefit of all,” according to a company statement. Nvidia said it was assured that licenses would be granted by the US government and “hopes to start deliveries soon.”\n\n“It is a positive signal not only for Nvidia and its related supply chain but also for broader markets given its implications for US-China trade talks,” said Richard Clode, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nStill, there’s no guarantee the new approvals will lead to flourishing business in China. Nvidia and AMD aren’t certain how many chips the new export licenses will cover or how long they will last, according to a person familiar with the matter. In China, the US chipmakers are only permitted to sell older, limited versions of their products. And many buyers in the country, where companies are rapidly churning out AI models, have moved to local suppliers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt’s also not clear how much Huang’s lobbying turned the tide. The concession was part of broader US negotiations with China, which the White House said will accept higher tariffs and cooperate on rare-earth minerals.\n\n“Senior administration officials are pretty clearly characterizing this as having been explicitly traded for what we got in those talks,” said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.\n\nHuang has argued that restrictions in China mean American chipmakers will cede the immense market to local rivals, chiefly Huawei Technologies Co. White House AI adviser David Sacks has echoed that, calling for an American “tech stack” — a set of complementary hardware and software services that the nation can export and control. Sacks, a tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist, was critical in reversing recent semiconductor restrictions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, arguing that the Gulf powerhouses would otherwise turn to China for their growing AI ambitions.\n\n“We are not selling the latest and greatest chips to China,” Sacks said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. “The policy is nuanced, and it makes a lot of sense.”\n\nBut there’s another contingent who view chip bans as a key way to keep Beijing from advancing in what’s widely seen as an AI arms race. The abrupt about-face this week came as a shock to many China hawks in the administration and on Capitol Hill, leaving several privately fuming, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nMany policymakers were in the dark on how the changes will be implemented and raced to get a better understanding of the mechanics, said these people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nThe House select committee on China plans to seek clarification from the Commerce Department on the reversal, according to the panel’s Republican chairman, Representative John Moolenaar. “It is crucial that the US maintain its lead” and keeps advanced AI out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, he said in a statement.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the policy change makes sense because Nvidia and AMD won’t be selling their latest chips in the market. “We want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology. They still rely upon it, and that’s key,” he said. “So we try to play that balance. We don’t sell them our best stuff.”\n\nThe US first restricted Nvidia’s sales in China in 2022, placing curbs designed to keep the most advanced AI resources from the Chinese military. In response, Nvidia designed new processors, including the H20. It’s an AI accelerator with certain components — such as memory access — deliberately limited to comply with US bans. Officials under President Joe Biden weighed the idea of placing restrictions on the H20 but ultimately didn’t.\n\nTrump then went ahead with the curbs in April, citing national security concerns.\n\nA month later, Huang said the US government was shooting itself in the foot with the policy. “All in all, the export controls were a failure. The facts would suggest it,” he told reporters in Taipei. He also said demand in China for AI chips would reach $50 billion in 2026 — a market that Trump basically kept his company out of.\n\nNvidia’s products are central to the creation and running of artificial intelligence software. The company has more than a 90% share in AI accelerators — chips that are the key component in giant data centers being built around the world.\n\nAccess to the chips have become a negotiating card for Trump during his trips to the Middle East, where he secured massive pledges from Gulf states to invest in the US. Along the way, he’s praised Huang for going further than some other tech CEOs, such as Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook.\n\nDuring a trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump scanned the crowd for the tech luminaries who joined him for an event.\n\nHe spotted Huang. “Thank you very much, Jensen. I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here. But you are,” the president said. “What a job you’ve done.”\n\n--With assistance from Laura Avetisyan, Brunella Tipismana Urbano and Alicia Diaz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThailand’s Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough Spot The New Third Rail in Silicon Valley: Investing in Chinese AI How Hims Became the King of Knockoff Weight-Loss Drugs ‘The Turbulence Is Brutal’: Four Shark Tank Businesses on Tariffs Will Trade War Make South India the Next Manufacturing Hub?\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US President Donald Trump said he reached a deal with Indonesia that will see goods from the country face a 19% tariff, while US exports will not be taxed.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\n“They are paying 19% and we are not paying anything,” Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House. “We are going to have full access to Indonesia.”\n\nTrump has sent tariff letters over the last week to multiple trading partners, increasing pressure on negotiators ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline for higher duties to take effect. A pact with Indonesia, which was threatened with a 32% tariff, would be the first struck with a country targeted by one of those messages to reduce their rate.\n\nIndonesia also agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets, “many of them 777’s,” Trump said later on social media.\n\n“If there is any Transshipment from a higher Tariff Country, then that Tariff will be added on to the Tariff that Indonesia is paying,” the president added.\n\nMarkets have been in wait-and-see mode on Trump’s trade proclamations, given he has changed rates and deadlines multiple times since he announced country-by-country tariffs on April 2 and then quickly paused them. Boeing shares increased as much as 0.8% on the announcement, while the dollar rose 0.4% on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was little changed after earlier topping 6,300.\n\nTrump initially announced the accord on social media, without providing specifics. He said he dealt directly with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to finalize the deal.\n\nIndonesia is preparing a joint statement with the US that will detail additional information, including non-tariff measures and commercial agreements, Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Secretary Susiwijono Moegiarso said in a text message late Tuesday in Jakarta.\n\nEarlier: Indonesia Touts ‘Sweetener’ as Negotiators Meet US Officials\n\nIndonesia’s top negotiator, Minister Airlangga Hartarto, last week met with US officials, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to hash out an improved agreement.\n\nSoutheast Asia’s largest economy had earlier proposed near-zero tariffs on about 70% of US imports, as well as business deals in critical minerals, energy, agriculture and defense, but that failed to convince Trump to lower the levy on Indonesian goods from the 32% rate he first set back in April.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAn agreement with Indonesia would be the fourth trade framework Trump has announced since pausing his country-specific tariffs, after Vietnam and the UK. The US and China also reached a tariff truce that includes the planned resumption of critical minerals and technology trade between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nThe pacts have thus far fallen short of full-fledged trade deals, with many details left to be negotiated later. Trump provided no paper to back up last week’s claim of a deal with Vietnam. The country’s leadership was caught off guard by Trump’s declaration that Hanoi agreed to a 20% tariff, and the Vietnamese government is still seeking to lower the rate, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEarlier: Apparel Tariffs Outside China: Is Vietnam’s 20% the New Normal?\n\nTrump has kept foreign governments and investors on edge about his tariff agenda, with partners rushing to avoid higher import taxes and markets facing yet another dose of uncertainty. The US president indicated Monday he preferred to stick with the levies in his letters, saying, “I really don’t want deals. I just want the paper to get sent.”\n\nThe president also said he was willing to continue talks with major economies, including the European Union.\n\nTrump over the last week unleashed a barrage of tariff demand letters, informing other economies of new duties set to begin Aug. 1 if they cannot negotiate better terms with the US. The missives extended what was initially a July 9 deadline for another three weeks, setting off another frantic dash of negotiations.\n\nThe slew of tariff threats from Trump have prompted economies to broaden trade ties beyond the US; Indonesia reached a tentative economic agreement with the EU over the weekend.\n\n“There is quite a level of frustration with these deals and more talk about exploring those other options, to include Europe,” said Erin Murphy, senior fellow on emerging Asia economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nSoutheast Asian nations — loathe to choose between the US and China — have long been caught in the middle of economic and political battles between the two superpowers. While Vietnam is said to be further along in trade negotiations with the US, Thailand is in ongoing talks and mulling how to reduce US duties without giving away too much and stoking domestic unrest.\n\nPhilippine officials also are pushing to secure a pact ahead of the new deadline, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. set to visit Washington later this month in an effort to reduce or eliminate Trump’s planned 20% tariff on the island nation.\n\n--With assistance from Grace Sihombing and Claire Jiao.\n\n(Adds markets in sixth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget DOGE.

          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) is unchanged, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +0.51%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.02%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.57%.\n\nStock indexes rallied early the session due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield is currently up +4.8 bp and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks.

by Merck (MRK) and American Express (AXP).\n\nToday’s CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was driven partly by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May’s +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May’s +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news today after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a “very good place” and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants “not to worry about August 12.”  Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is “all part of a mosaic” in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.  Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%. Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don’t relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nToday’s July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June’s level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD) is down -3% today due to some long liquidation pressure following the recent rally on hopes for more favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled, “Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,” which may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May.  Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan’s US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports today include Blackrock, Citigroup, JP Morgan, NY Bank of Mellon, Wells Fargo, and State Street. Key earnings reports Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.31%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -13.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield is up by +4.8 bp at 4.481%.  T-note prices being undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 55% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate today rose to a 4.75-month high and is currently up +1.5 bp at 2.419%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration’s campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued today, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed’s independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition.  Mr. Powell’s term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May-2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell’s term ends in May 2026, or earlier “for cause,” based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed’s building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp at 2.710%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +2.2 bp at 4.622%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are trading higher today, except for Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA).  Apple (AAPL) Apple is up more than +1% after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp.\n\nIn Tesla (TSLA) news today, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla’s top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks are doing well today after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is up more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than +4% on the news.  Arm Holdings (ARM) is up more than +3%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are mixed today as bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -3% on some long liquidation pressure after posting a new record high on Monday. Riot Platforms (RIOT) is down more than -3%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR) is more than -1%, but Coinbase Global (COIN) is up +0.4%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is down more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) is down -0.4% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners are trading lower today after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products.  Freeport McMoRan (FCX) is down more than -4%, and Southern Copper (SCCO) is down more than -3%.\n\nEarnings

          "title": "America's only rare earth producer gets a boost from Apple and Pentagon agreements",
          "content": "MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine, announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple on Tuesday to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of last week’s announcement that the U.S. Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based company. That will make the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials and help increase magnet production.\n\nDespite their name, the 17 rare earth elements aren’t actually rare, but it’s hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.\n\nThey are important ingredients in everything from smartphones and submarines to EVs and fighter jets, and it's those military applications that have made rare earths a key concern in ongoing U.S. trade talks. That's because China dominates the market and imposed new limits on exports after President Donald Trump announced his widespread tariffs. When shipments dried up, the two sides sat down in London.\n\nThe agreement with Apple will allow MP Materials to further expand its new factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce the magnets that make iPhones vibrate. The company expects to start producing magnets for GM's electric vehicles later this year and this agreement will let it start producing magnets for Apple in 2027.\n\nThe Apple agreement represents a tenth of the company's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically during the Trump administration. And although the deal will provide a significant boost for MP Materials, the agreement with the Defense Department may be even more meaningful.\n\nNeha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that the Pentagon's 10-year promise to guarantee a minimum price for the key elements of neodymium and praseodymium will guarantee stable revenue for MP Minerals and protect it from potential price cuts by Chinese producers that are subsidized by their government.\n\n“This is the kind of long-term commitment needed to reshape global rare earth supply chains,\" Mukherjee said.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths. His administration is both helping MP Materials and trying to encourage the development of new mines that would take years to come to fruition. China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply. The fear is that the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements that could disrupt production of a variety of products. MP Materials can't satisfy all of the U.S. demand from its Mountain Pass mine in California’s Mojave Desert.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe deals by MP Materials come as Beijing and Washington have agreed to walk back on their non-tariff measures: China is to grant export permits for rare earth magnets to the U.S., and the U.S. is easing export controls on chip design software and jet engines. The truce is intended to ease tensions and prevent any catastrophic fall-off in bilateral relations, but is unlikely to address fundamental differences as both governments take steps to reduce dependency on each other.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters David Klepper and Didi Tang contributed to this report from Washington D.C.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a regular feature of Cramer’s morning show. Earlier during the year, the CNBC host defended the stock after shares struggled due to weakness in the Chinese smartphone market. Cramer continued to defend Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after analysts soured on its Siri and perceived AI weakness. He continued to defend the company, and this time, Cramer discussed reports suggesting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook should leave the company:\n\n“[On analysts saying Tim Cook should leave] I wanted to say, I thought it was outrageous. I thought that was outrageous. I wish that I could’ve, that I would love to be able to be Tim Cook and say what I’ve done for the shareholders. And it’s just incredible. The amount of wealth that man has created. I mean that’s like when I saw, at one point today I saw in premarket that NVIDIA was down. I was going to call for Jensen’s firing. . .I mean come on. . .you know Jensen has to go. Can we like stop? Like stop? Like Tim Cook’s great.”Apple Inc. (AAPL): It's \"Outrageous\" To Say Tim Cook Should Leave, Says Jim Cramer\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nCramer discussed key traits for a potential Tim Cook successor earlier. Here is what he said:\n\n“[On Morgan Stanley saying Tim Cook’s successor could benefit from having a hardware background] Well look, it’s funny hardware is part of the, I’m glad you mentioned hardware, hardware’s part of the issue of how NVIDIA got to where it is. This is an essentially, there’s a belief in many people on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, that hardware prevails here because we’re gonna get rid of a huge number of people who would do SaaS, you know, software as a service, and that includes, yes, Salesforce, includes ServiceNow, includes DataDog which got out of the S&P. Because there are going to be fewer and fewer people who are actually in the organization who need that. But that does not mean that you wouldn’t need more Apple.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

While the restructuring will result in one-time charges of $11.0 million to $12.5 million, investors appear to be focused on the positive outlook and the company's efforts to improve operational efficiency and drive future profitability.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $8.30, up 1% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Jamf? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nJamf’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock dropped 3.9% after a broader market sell-off triggered by renewed trade tensions. U.S. stock indices fell after the Trump administration announced intentions to impose a 35% tariff on many goods imported from Canada.\n\nThis move is far more than a typical trade dispute; it targets the United States' largest and most deeply integrated trading partner. Canada is not merely a neighbor but a critical component of North American supply chains, particularly in sectors like automotive, energy, and critical minerals.\n\nThis move sparked concerns about potential retaliatory actions and a wider impact on the North American economy, leading to a risk-off sentiment among investors. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all opened lower, pulling back from recent record highs and heading for their first weekly loss in three weeks.\n\nJamf is down 41.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.30 per share, it is trading 56.1% below its 52-week high of $18.91 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Jamf’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $211.74.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView Comments",

US stocks trading mixed today after a relatively tame CPI report failed to ease Wall Street's concerns about the impact of tariffs. Traders on Wall Street now largely expecting the Fed to keep rates on hold at its July meeting. Plus, investors are also monitoring earnings from Wall Street's biggest banks. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond said on the company's earnings call that President Trump's trade policies pose quote significant risk to the US economy. He also stressed the importance of Fed independence. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reporting yet another high-level departure at Tesla. Troy Jones, who was Tesla's top sales executive in North America, has departed the EV maker after 15 years at the company. The departure comes as Tesla is facing a steep drop in sales. And MP materials shares surging today after Apple struck a $500 million deal with the company to buy rare earth minerals. Apple said the spending on rare earth minerals is part of its earlier pledge to invest more than $500 billion in the US economy. And that's Yahoo Finance market minute.

          "content": "Stock Market Today: Dow slumps; S&P 500 and Nasdaq rally originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nUpdated 12:29 p.m. EDT\n\nIt's a tale of two markets: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, weighted in favor of the highest-priced stocks, is slumping. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq indexes, weighted in favor of market capitalizations, are higher.\n\nIt's more than that. The Dow has includes six financial stocks, 20% of the total, and they're all lower today:\n\nJP Morgan Chase  (JPM) , Goldman Sachs  (GS) , UnitedHealth Group  (UNH) , Travelers Companies  (TRV) , American Express  (AXP)  and Visa  (V) .\n\nThe winners so far today are techs: Nvidia  (NVDA) , Microsoft  (MSFT) , and Apple  (AAPL)  and the top dog in consumer discretionary stocks: Amazon.com  (AMZN) .\n\nAnd Goldman is the priciest of the Dow stocks at $706, while Amazon, Apple and Nvidia are among the lower-priced stocks. Microsoft is the outlier of the group at $507, up nearly $4.\n\nAt 12:25 ET, the Dow was down 280 points at 44,180. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was 1 point at 6,267, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 126 points at 20,767.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Index was up 111 points to 22,966 after hitting a new high of 23.051.\n\nUpdated 10:18 a.m. EDT\n\nStocks Mixed Early On\n\nIn the first half-hour of trading, the major indexes were mostly higher. We say mostly because the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 87 points, which is actually a small decline on a percentage basis. The blue-chips were at 44,373, off 0.2%.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up a modest eight points to 6,277, but that was after hitting a 52-week high right after the open.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite had added 112 points or 0.5% to 20,753. It also hit a 52-week high soon after the open. Not to be a party pooper, the Nasdaq-100 Index was up 130 points to 22,986 after hitting a new high of 23.051.\n\nNvidia  (NVDA) , Broadcom AVGO and Coinbase  (COIN)  also hit new highs. Bitcoin was off $1,559 to $118,377, a day after hitting a new high of $123,166.\n\nStock market today: The banks weigh in\n\nThis morning's earnings reports are all about the banks.\n\nJP Morgan Chase  (JPM) , BlackRock  (BLK) , Citigroup  (C) , Wells Fargo  (WFC)  and Bank of New York Mellon  (BK)  all reported earnings that topped expectations. As for future statements, not all was rosy, with Wells Fargo guiding lower.\n\nCitigroup is the only one trading higher, gaining as much as 3%, while Wells Fargo is down close to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is the other big news this morning. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that June CPI rose 0.3%, which was in line with expectations.\n\nYear over year, the CPI gained 2.7%. That's faster than May's 2.4% increase. Higher food and energy costs were behind the faster inflation, Bloomberg reported.\n\nCore CPI gained 0.2%, which was better than expected. The core figure was below forecasts for the fifth straight month, the news service reported.US BLS\n\nSo, how are stocks looking this morning?\n\nUp! S&P 500 futures have been rallying since yesterday's close (black line, below) and are up 0.4%.ThinkOrSwim\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is even stronger, gaining 0.7% in premarket trading.ThinkOrSwim\n\nThe long end of the U.S. treasury curve is stronger (yields are down). Gold and crude are lower, while copper is slightly higher.\n\nStock Market Today: Dow slumps; S&P 500 and Nasdaq rally first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 15, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 15, 2025, where it first appeared.\n\nView Comments",

The complaint alleges that Apple misrepresented Siri’s advanced AI-based features as well as its ability to deliver them within the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nIn truth, as alleged, Apple lacked a functional prototype of Siri’s purported advanced AI-based features and misrepresented the time it would take to integrate such features into its devices.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced it was indefinitely delaying several AI-based Siri features, citing development delays and pushing their release to sometime “in the coming year.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $11.59 per share, or almost 5%, from $239.07 per share on March 7, 2025, to $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nThen, on June 9, 2025, Apple hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference for 2025. Noticeably, Apple failed to announce any new updates regarding advanced Siri features. Analysts and media outlets described the WWDC as “underwhelming” and “disappointing,” with CNN stating that “it’s unlikely that any of the announcements made at Monday’s event will change the perception that Apple is behind its competitors in AI.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $2.47 per share, or over 1%, from $203.92 on June 6, 2025, to $201.45 per share on June 9, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Apple you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.\n\nAdditional Research Links\n\nTop NASDAQ 100 Stocks\n\nTop Technology Stocks\n\nTop Large-Cap Growth Stocks\n\nHigh Momentum Stocks\n\nHigh Insider Ownership Stocks\n\nExcess Returns Investing Podcast\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

          "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares tick higher in pre-market trading after the company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, though looming pharmaceutical tariffs from President Trump remain a key risk for the sector.\n\nMP Materials (MP) stock jumped after Apple (AAPL) announced a $500 million deal to buy rare earth magnets and build a rare earth recycling facility in California.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief: Market Sunrise here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nNow some more breaking news on the earnings front, as the pharma sector braces for more clarity on tariffs. Johnson & Johnson reporting earnings this morning, kicking off earnings for the healthcare sector. The company reporting second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.77, but keep, keep part of this release really is the company boosting its full-year sales outlook and boosting its full-year earnings outlook, its profit outlook. So Johnson & Johnson now seeing full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $10.80 to $10.90, previously it had guided for a range of $10.50 to $10.70. On full-year sales, the company now sees a range of $93 or sorry, $93.2 billion to $93.6 billion, previously it had seen a range of 91 to 91.8. So you're seeing stock slightly higher here up a little bit over 1% on this boosted forecast. But key though for the sector, as we had talked about earlier this morning for Johnson & Johnson, is the fact that pretty soon President Trump has warned that there will be tariffs coming on the pharma sector. So it will be interesting to see of course how those could impact this company, what management says on the call about this about those tariffs and looming risks when it comes to that. Now you might have also heard about MP Materials in recent days. That stock closed 20% higher on Tuesday, and this is another trending ticker that I want to highlight for us. That stock is up about 4.5% in pre-market up almost 4% now. The fresh surge in MP, that's the ticker, comes after Apple announced that it would buy rare earth magnets from the company in a $500 million deal. The deal will sell, we'll see Apple and MP materials launch a recycling facility in California for processing and we'll be keeping a close eye on MP materials over the next several sessions.

          "content": "Key Points\n\nApple, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola are among Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. Those looking for passive income will find compelling opportunities in these three positions. Various industries are represented in the portfolio, such as AI, electric vehicles, and energy. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nWarren Buffett -- one of the most highly esteemed investors of all time, if not the most -- has been a consistent source of investing insights for decades. In addition to his numerous pearls of wisdom, the stock purchases Buffett makes through his conglomerate, BerkshireHathaway, are also closely followed.\n\nHere are 10 stocks from the Berkshire portfolio that bear the Buffett seal of approval and are worth loading up on right now.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThough not a major holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) demands serious consideration from investors seeking exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), e-commerce, and other segments. Its Amazon Web Services unit, in particular, continues to be a great growth engine for the company, and it will likely remain so for many years to come as AI flourishes.\n\nShares look attractively valued now at 17.7 times operating cash flow, compared to its five-year average cash flow multiple of 20.4.\n\n2. Apple\n\nThe largest holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has plunged almost 16% year to date as of this writing. Thanks to its fiercely loyal customer base, it steadily generates strong profits and cash flows.\n\nWith the haircut it has received so far in 2025, investors have the chance to pick up shares of the tech stalwart at a lower price point than when the year began.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC), one of the nation's largest financial institutions, demonstrated its sound financial health during the recent 2025 stress test. It has rewarded shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend over the past decade, making Bank of America a great choice for those interested in a leading financial stock, but who are not interested in large exposure to the risks in smaller regional banks.\n\n4. BYD\n\nAlthough BYD's (OTC: BYDD.F) electric vehicles (EV) aren't seen on American highways and byways, the company's dominance in the global EV market is indisputable. Investors have pumped the brakes on BYD stock over the past month, and shares are available on the cheap, trading at 2.5 times forward earnings.\n\n5. Chevron\n\nFor an opportunity to add ample passive income into investors' portfolios, there's Chevron(NYSE: CVX). This oil giant has consistently increased its dividend -- now offering a 4.5% forward yield -- for nearly four decades. Despite the downturn in energy prices over the past year, Chevron stock has remained resilient, demonstrating its allure as a way to gain energy exposure.\n\nStory Continues\n\n6. Coca-Cola\n\nThe fourth-largest Berkshire Hathaway position, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), first appeared in the portfolio in 1988. The company, founded in 1886, now owns a variety of beverage brands beyond soft drinks, making it the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company. It's a Dividend King, having logged 63 consecutive years of payout growth.\n\n7. Kraft Heinz\n\nDown about 17% since the start of 2025, Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) has fallen out of favor with investors due to lagging sales, yet there are numerous reasons not to dismiss this food and beverage leader. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, and shares are inexpensively valued at 10.1 times forward earnings.\n\n8. Moody's\n\nThe credit ratings, research, and risk analysis services that Moody's(NYSE: MCO) provides allow businesses and investors to make more informed financial decisions. Its invaluable services will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future, making it a worthy consideration for investors looking to fortify their portfolios with a more conservative opportunity.\n\n9. Occidental Petroleum\n\nUnlike Chevron's operations up and down the energy value chain, OccidentalPetroleum(NYSE: OXY) is an oil and gas company focused (though not exclusively) on exploration and production in the United States. This business model means the stock is highly correlated with energy prices, illustrating why it's down almost 25% over the past year. But the shares should recover and be a long-term winner.\n\n10. Visa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) has about 1.3 billion credit cards in circulation worldwide, an impressive global presence. With the various fees it collects from users, the company generates consistently strong cash flows. From 2015 through 2024, for example, Visa grew its free cash flow at a 15% compound annual rate.\n\nThe stock has provided stellar returns for investors over the long term, and the company's growth potential suggests that its shares will soar even higher in years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "Investors are cooling on Apple (AAPL) as other tech giants race ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nNew York Life Investments economist and portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss why Apple's slow rollout of AI features has left it behind peers that are already delivering consumer use cases.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian Sozzi\n\nAll right, it's time now for our question of the day. How popular is Apple's stock right now? Uh, maybe not such a crazy question. Here's why I'm bringing this up. In today's BFA fund manager survey, it was noted that in the past three months, since April, global investors have raised their allocation to the tech sector by the largest amount since March 2009. During that span, though, Apple stock has underperformed Google, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia by a country mile. Lauren, what happened to Apple? It used to be I mean, everybody seemingly owns Apple, but now they are perhaps owning more of everything else in the AI space.\n\n00:43 Lauren\n\nWell, I can't speak to Apple specifically, but I can speak to something I see very clearly happening within this, uh, this tech space. We've spoken a lot today about the foundational layer of artificial intelligence, the semiconductor chip makers, uh, manufacturers. Um, we haven't spoken as much about the infrastructure layer, the energy companies. And then there's a third layer, the application layer. And this is where many companies outside of Apple have had more early, um, releases, opportunities for their customers to deeply engage with new functions related to AI and what that can do in their daily lives. And that application layer, we are really only in the very earliest, I would even say pre-stages of what that will look like, not only for us as consumers, but also for businesses and the technologies that they use to enable their workforce. And so I would say, um, the jury is still certainly out over who the winners and losers will be. And elements of, um, data and personal security, where Apple has historically been strong, might be areas that, uh, gain more importance as this application layer builds out.\n\n02:34 Brian Sozzi\n\nUh, Allie, I I'm going to decode this movement in in, uh, Apple in real time. I'm using my iPhone to download AI applications from everybody else. And until Apple comes out with its own AI functions, they need to do They're not They're unlikely to regain that story, that that bullish thesis.\n\n03:02 Alexandra Canal\n\nYeah, and that's a big reason why we've seen these year-to-date declines. They've just disappointed on the AI story. And fun fact, B. Brian, Nvidia is $1 trillion larger than Apple at the current moment. That just gives some perspective here. But to Lauren's point, the use cases on the consumer side for AI, we just haven't been there yet. And that's an area that down the line, Apple could potentially double down on it, and we could see that momentum. Right now, it's really focused on those hyperscalers, a lot of B2B, for a company like Meta that's been utilized by its advertisers, especially its smaller advertisers. So that's why we've been able to to see these outside gains in some of these other MAG 7 companies. Apple typically They're not the innovators here. They usually sit back, they wait for the innovators to to do their thing, and then they come in and make a better product. So that could be something that we see down the line here. Uh, you know, Apple also focused on that user privacy data. We have seen some, you know, shaky data with, uh, Chat GPT, Gemini, those types of products. So again, something that Apple might just want to sit on their heels and wait a little bit.\n\n04:43 Brian Sozzi\n\nJust fix Siri, please, Apple, and tell us things aren't going to be, uh, bad in China.

          "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff decisions since he took office on January 20 have shocked financial markets and sent a wave of uncertainty through the global economy.\n\nHere is a timeline of the major developments:\n\nFebruary 1 - Trump imposes 25% tariffs on Mexican and most Canadian imports and 10% on goods from China, demanding they curb the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S.\n\nFebruary 3 - Trump agrees to a 30-day pause in his tariff threat on Mexico and Canada in return for concessions on border and crime enforcement. The U.S. does not reach such a deal with China.\n\nFebruary 10 - Trump raises tariffs on steel and aluminum to a flat 25% \"without exceptions or exemptions\".\n\nMarch 3 - Trump says 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada will take effect from March 4 and doubles fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20%.\n\nMarch 6 - Trump exempts goods from Canada and Mexico under a North American trade pact for a month.\n\nMarch 26 - Trump unveils a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks.\n\nApril 2 - Trump announces global tariffs with a baseline of 10% across all imports and significantly higher duties on some of the United States’ biggest trading partners.\n\nApril 9 - Trump pauses for 90 days most of his country-specific tariffs that kicked in less than 24 hours earlier after an upheaval in financial markets erased trillions of dollars from bourses around the world.\n\nThe 10% blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports stays in place.\n\nTrump says he will raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that took effect a day earlier. This pushes the extra duties on Chinese goods to 145%, including the previously imposed tariffs.\n\nMay 9 - Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announce a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place 10% tariffs on British exports and lowers U.S. duties on British car exports.\n\nMay 12 - The U.S. and China agree to temporarily slash reciprocal tariffs. Under the 90-day truce, the U.S. will cut the extra tariffs it imposed on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China’s duties on U.S. imports will be slashed to 10% from 125%.\n\nMay 13 - The U.S. cuts the low value \"de minimis\" tariff on China shipments, reducing duties for items valued at up to $800 to 54% from 120%.\n\nMay 23 - Trump says he is recommending a straight 50% tariff on goods from the European Union starting on June 1. He backpedals on this threat two days later.\n\nHe also warns Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) it would face a 25% tariff if phones it sold in the U.S. were manufactured outside of the country.\n\nMay 29 - A federal appeals court temporarily reinstates the most sweeping of Trump’s tariffs, pausing an earlier lower court’s ruling to consider the government’s appeal.\n\nJune 3 - Trump signs an executive proclamation activating a hike in the steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% from 25%.\n\nJune 12 - Trump warns he may soon hike auto tariffs.\n\nJuly 3 - Trump says the U.S. will place a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports, with trans-shipments from third countries through Vietnam facing a 40% levy.\n\nJuly 6 - Trump says on Truth Social that countries aligning themselves with the \"Anti-American policies\" of BRICS will be charged an additional 10% tariff.\n\nJuly 7 - Trump says on Truth Social the additional higher duties announced in earlier months will kick in with a delay on August 1. In letters sent to 14 countries including Japan, South Korea and Serbia, he says that will include tariffs between 25% and 40%.\n\nJuly 10 - Trump says the U.S. will impose a 35% tariff on imports from Canada in August and plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most other trading partners.\n\nJuly 12 - Trump threatens to impose a 30% tariff on imports from Mexico and the EU from August 1.\n\nJuly 15 - Trump says the U.S. will impose a 19% tariff on goods from Indonesia under a new agreement. </p>",

          "title": "Here's Why Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is a Buy Before Aug. 2",
          "content": "Key Points\n\nBerkshire is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Saturday, Aug. 2.  There are a few numbers that Berkshire investors will be watching closely. Berkshire’s stock looks like a strong value right now. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) presents its earnings reports a little differently. For one thing, management doesn't hold quarterly earnings calls like most companies do. And CEO Warren Buffett insists on releasing earnings reports on Saturdays, so investors will have plenty of time to digest the numbers before the stock market opens.\n\nThere are a few key numbers investors will be watching when Berkshire reports its second-quarter results, expected on Saturday, Aug. 2. Berkshire's operating earnings from its businesses is the most obvious example. There's also the company's cash stockpile, which reached an all-time high of $347.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nFinally, while we won't know what specific stocks Berkshire bought and sold until a few weeks after its earnings report when it has to file with the government, we can typically figure out if Berkshire was a net buyer or seller of stocks during the quarter by looking at the reported cost basis of its investment portfolio. And we'll also get details about whether Berkshire decided to buy back any of its own stock.\n\nIn this article, I'll discuss why this trillion-dollar company could be a solid investment before earnings.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire should be more valuable now\n\nDuring the second quarter, which is the period Berkshire is getting ready to report, the S&P 500 increased by 10.4%, and many of Berkshire's top stock holdings performed quite well. Although Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell slightly during the quarter on tariff concerns, Berkshire's second- and third-largest investments, American Express(NYSE: AXP) and Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), increased by 20% and 15%, respectively, during the second quarter. Despite all of this, Berkshire's stock is significantly lower than where it started the quarter, mainly because CEO Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the company's May annual meeting.\n\nAlso, while we won't know Berkshire's stock portfolio activity for the second quarter until mid-August, it's highly likely that Berkshire's already massive $348 billion cash stockpile has grown even larger. However, as I'll discuss in a bit, I also wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that Berkshire had resumed buybacks in the second quarter, which could limit the growth of the company's cash.\n\nFinally, Berkshire has a collection of (mostly) tariff-resistant businesses. Of course, there could still be some secondary impacts of tariffs on businesses that operate exclusively in the U.S., but Berkshire is more insulated from the impacts of import tariffs than most.\n\nA better value than you might think\n\nAt the current stock price, Berkshire Hathaway has a market cap of about $1.02 trillion, which is significantly less than just a couple months ago, before Buffett announced his planned retirement. Meanwhile, the value of the stock portfolio has increased significantly, and Berkshire still has the same (or more) cash.\n\nThink of it this way. Berkshire's stock portfolio is worth approximately $292 billion as of this writing. Removing that and the $348 billion in cash shows a valuation of about $380 billion for Berkshire's operating businesses.\n\nWe'll get updated numbers soon, but Berkshire has generated about $33 billion in operating profit from its businesses over the past four quarters, excluding investment income. This shows that the market is valuing Berkshire's businesses at just 11.5 times operating earnings. The last time I looked at the numbers was late May, and this ratio was 14. That's why I wouldn't be shocked if we find out Berkshire resumed buybacks.\n\nIs Berkshire a buy before earnings?\n\nTo be sure, I have no idea what Berkshire Hathaway's earnings will be, and some parts of the report (insurance underwriting income, for example) can be rather unpredictable. But the bottom line is that this is a rock-solid business trading well below highs at a time when the S&P 500 is near its all-time peak.\n\nWarren Buffett's departure isn't likely to have any massive impact on the day-to-day business; Berkshire still has an excellent team of leaders; and the company has unmatched financial flexibility to pursue opportunities if and when they arise. Berkshire is already one of the largest stock investments in my portfolio, but if the current price level persists, I'm likely to add shares. It is a buy before earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

          "title": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
          "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you're looking to park in an investment worth owning for a while? That's easier said than done right now. Although the market isn't exactly dangerous at this time, stocks are relatively expensive, given the degree of economic uncertainty ahead.\n\nNevertheless, a handful of tickers are not only still worth owning here but also worth buying at their current prices. If you need help finding some of these names, just start with the stocks Warren Buffett is holding, if not buying more of.\n\nTo this end, here's a closer look at three stocks currently found in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio that would likely be at home in your portfolio, too.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nIt's not entirely clear what Buffett himself sees in Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI), but he clearly sees something. Berkshire's 110 million-share stake in the company is one-third of Sirius itself, thanks to the purchase of another $42 million worth of the stock just within the past few days.\n\nOf course, Sirius XM is North America's one and only satellite radio service, although the company is more than that. In addition to web-accessible access to its satellite-delivered programming, Sirius owns the internet radio platform Pandora. Roughly three-fourths of its revenue comes from subscription fees, and most of the rest comes from advertising.\n\nIt's a business model that's being increasingly questioned, and understandably so. There's a virtual universe of audio entertainment available online, and Pew Research reports that 90% of adults living in the United States own a smartphone -- they have their own web-connected entertainment device with them at all times, in and out of a vehicle.\n\nConsumers arguably don't need satellite radio anymore. In this vein, the company's subscriber base has dwindled from its late-2022 peak of nearly 32.4 million to just under 31.5 million paying customers as of the middle of this year. It's not catastrophic, but it is a concern.\n\nThis attrition may also have run its full course, however, and is set to reverse direction. Sirius is still adding new podcasts, overhauling its pricing plans, and -- thanks to the introduction of an advertising-sales technology (Trade Desk's Unified ID 2.0, to be specific) -- is well positioned to grow the advertising aspect of its business, which will ultimately make its programming cheaper (or even free) to tune in to. This will also create and free up funds to do more marketing.\n\nOf course, Sirius XM stock's forward-looking dividend yield of 4% isn't too shabby either.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nOil and gas stocks haven't always been Warren Buffett's cup of tea. Although most of these tickers pay good dividends when they can, these companies' bottom lines are closely tethered to unpredictable oil prices. The Oracle of Omaha generally isn't into these kinds of guessing games.\n\nThat's what makes his commitment to energy outfit Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) so interesting -- and telling. Since it was first added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio back in 2022, not only has Buffett continued to add to the position, but he's also made a point of touting it. As he wrote in this year's letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:\n\nUnder Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\n\nBuffett adds, \"We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States,\" most of which are in the well-proven Permian Basin and nearby areas.\n\nBut wait -- isn't the crude oil business on its way out? Not so fast.\n\nWhile renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are obviously the future, there's a growing need for power right now. It could take decades for this transition to do any permanent damage to the oil and gas business. Indeed, Bloomberg expects demand for oil to continue growing through 2035, with this demand only waning about 10% from that 2035 peak by 2050.\n\nTranslation: There's a lot of money to be made by extracting oil and gas from the ground in the meantime. Now, all of a sudden, Warren Buffett's seemingly unlikely interest in Occidental makes a lot of sense.\n\nBank of America\n\nFinally, add Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) to your list of Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now.\n\nIt's an eyebrow-raising call. If you keep tabs on Warren Buffett's trades, then you likely know Berkshire's been shedding its Bank of America (BofA) stake since the middle of this year, paring back its position in the big bank by about one-fourth of its peak size. He's still actively selling this stock, too. Plenty of investors have been interpreting these sales as a sign of impending trouble for the bank.\n\nAnd, perhaps, Buffett is concerned about the company's foreseeable future.\n\nThere's also a distinct possibility, however, that Berkshire's simply scaling back on a (very) profitable trade before potential changes in tax laws can go into effect that might make unrealized gains on big trades taxable. In this vein, Berkshire has also been selling pieces of its profitable position in Apple of late, which is still Berkshire's biggest trade despite the recent culling.\n\nAlso, even with the frantic panic resulting from the streak of sales since July, the remaining 766 million-share, $32.4 billion stake in BofA leaves it as Berkshire's third-biggest holding. Maybe Buffett is just trying to reduce his position in BofA to less than 10% of the bank itself, which lifts the requirement to immediately disclose any buys or sales of the stock in question.\n\nSure, like most other banks, this one's grappling with waning loan demand and rising loan defaults. Last quarter's net interest income slipped 3% year over year, while charge-offs for soured loans -- although still absorbable -- grew 65% for the same timeframe.\n\nThere's a reason shares of Bank of America have been climbing since August's low, however, and are back within sight of new 52-week highs. Take that hint while the stock's forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 2.5%. You'll be plugging into one of the biggest leading names in a business the world absolutely needs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "[President Trump Departs The White House For Pittsburgh]\nAnna Moneymaker/Getty Images News\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month, with levies on semiconductors potentially following a similar timeline.\n\n“Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff,” Trump told reporters as he returned to Washington following an AI summit in Pittsburgh.\n\nHe added that tariffs on chips would follow a “similar” timeline and described them as “less complicated” to implement, though he did not elaborate.\n\nTrump previously announced plans for a 50% tariff on copper and launched a Section 232 investigation into drug imports, citing national security threats. The pharmaceutical duties could rise as high as 200% after the initial phase-in, posing risks to companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE]), Merck (NYSE:MRK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK]), and Eli Lilly (LLY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY]), which rely on overseas production. Semiconductor tariffs are expected to affect both chipmakers and electronics manufacturers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF]).\n\nTrump said he’s in talks with five to six countries and may strike “two or three” deals before his reciprocal tariffs take effect August 1, adding that a deal with India was among the most likely. “I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” he said.\n\nRelated chip stocks: AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD]), Broadcom (AVGO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO]), Qualcomm (QCOM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM]), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM]), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU]), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]), Applied Materials (AMAT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT]), KLA (KLAC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAC]), ASML (ASML [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML]) and Lam Research (LRCX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX]).\n\nMORE ON PFIZER, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, ETC.\n\n \t* TSMC's Q2 Earnings Preview - More Strength To Come [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801243-tsmc-stock-q2-earnings-preview-more-strength-to-come]\n \t* Taiwan Semiconductor: The 'Go To' Factory For AI Boom [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801144-taiwan-semiconductor-the-go-to-factory-for-ai-boom]\n \t* Intel Is Not For The Faint Of Heart [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800906-intel-is-not-for-the-faint-of-heart]\n \t* MP Materials rips to all-time high after $500M deal that ensures Apple supply apart from China [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467674-mp-materials-rips-to-all-time-high-after-500m-deal-that-ensures-apple-supply-apart-from-china]\n \t* Hearing, sleep apnea features for AirPods, Apple Watch available in Asia [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467599-hearing-sleep-apnea-features-airpods-apple-watch-available-asia]\n\n ",

          "content": "[Stock market data with uptrend vector]\nsitox\n\nMP Materials (NYSE:MP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP]) closed +20% on Tuesday, posting an all-time intraday high of $62.87, after unveiling its $500M deal with Apple [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467429-apple-confirms-500m-investment-in-rare-earths-miner-mp-materials] (NASDAQ:AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) to develop a recycling line for rare earth materials that will allow MP to reprocess rare earth elements for use in Apple products.\n\nThe partnership includes a $200M prepayment from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) for a supply of magnets scheduled to begin in 2027, to be produced at MP's (NYSE:MP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP]) Fort Worth, Texas, facility using magnets recycled at MP's Mountain Pass, California, mining complex.\n\nFor Apple (AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]), the deal guarantees [https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-invest-500-million-rare-earths-mine-operator-mp-materials-fox-business-2025-07-15/] a steady flow of rare earths and magnets free from China, and analysts say the cost to support U.S. magnet production pales in comparison to the long-term risk that it could lose access entirely to the critical components.\n\nApple's (AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) move \"makes complete sense [https://www.reuters.com/business/apple-invest-500-million-rare-earths-mine-operator-mp-materials-fox-business-2025-07-15/]\" given that the company requires significant amounts of rare earth magnets for its devices, \"plus, by focusing on a U.S.-based supplier, it does help position Apple more positively in Washington,\" according to Bob O'Donnell, president at market research firm TECHnalysis Research.\n\nThe deal comes days after MP (MP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP]) agreed to a multibillion-dollar deal [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4466403-mp-materials-soars-on-partnership-with-pentagon-to-boost-u-s-rare-earth-magnet-supply] with the U.S. Department of Defense that will see the Pentagon become the company's largest shareholder and financial backstop.\n\nApple (AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]), which sold about 232 million iPhones last year, according to data from IDC, did not disclose which devices will include MP's (MP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP]) magnets; MP said the deal will supply magnets for hundreds of millions of devices, which would constitute a significant share of any of Apple's product lines.\n\nThe deal between MP Materials (MP [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP]) and the Pentagon establishes the first neodymium-praseodymium price floor outside China - a milestone for the rare earth market - that includes a floor price of $110/kg, 77% higher than the spot price, Macquarie analysts said, expecting more deals to follow.\n\n\"We believe additional agreements could be secured with continued involvement from the U.S. government to encourage the development of a reliable rare earth elements supply chain,\" Macquarie wrote. \"Furthermore, European countries may follow suit, taking swift action to establish their own magnet supply chains to meet both civil and defense requirements.\"\n\nMORE ON MP MATERIALS\n\n \t* MP Materials: Contender To Be Top REE Company Outside Of China [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801016-mp-materials-contender-to-be-top-ree-company-outside-china]\n \t* MP Materials: DoD Deal Is A Huge Win For Shareholders [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800590-mp-materials-dod-deal-huge-win-for-shareholders]\n \t* MP Materials Presents at J.P.

          "content": "A startup created by Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)) is stepping into the broadband spotlight as it goes after a share of the federal government's $42.5 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. The company, Taara, says in a blog post that its wireless Lightbridge technology can beam high-speed internet over the air, offering an alternative to both fiber and satellite options.\n\nTaara has stated on X that it is “BEAD-ready,” referencing the initiative backed by the U.S. government. The post followed a major revision to the BEAD rules by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced in early June, which now encourages technology neutrality rather than prioritizing traditional gigabit fiber. That change gives companies like Taara a chance to compete directly with Elon Musk's Starlink and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) 5G Home Internet for funding.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the announcement that the revised BEAD guidelines reflect a shift toward technology neutrality, aiming to deliver high-speed internet more efficiently and cost-effectively without prioritizing any single approach.\n\nAlphabet's Taara Targets the Broadband Dead Zone Starlink Can't Reach\n\nTaara is led by Mahesh Krishnaswamy, a former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google engineer who spun the project out of Alphabet's X moonshot factory after working on its earlier initiative, Loon. He has been focused on bridging global connectivity gaps since his early days in Chennai, India. \"Today, there are like 3 billion people still unconnected, and there is a dire need to bring them online,\" Krishnaswamy told Wired. His mission, he says, is to find scalable ways to bring high-speed internet to the places the fiber can't reach.\n\nRather than laying cable underground or relying on orbiting satellites, Taara says it uses devices installed on towers to send internet signals through the air across distances of up to 20 kilometers. The company positions this technology as a solution to the \"middle mile\" infrastructure gap, which connects the main internet backbone to local delivery systems like fiber or 5G towers.\n\nTrending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share\n\nAccording to Taara, this part of the network is especially crucial in remote and challenging environments, where last-mile connections often remain isolated without an efficient link to the larger grid. \"Without it, even the last-mile fiber connections or 5G cell towers remain stranded, unable to reach the broader internet,\" the company wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet’s GFiber says Taara’s Lightbridge can deliver speeds of up to 20 Gbps with ultra-low latency and no packet loss under clear weather conditions. This was demonstrated during a test in San Francisco with GFiber, which reported performance that matched high-end wired networks and exceeded traditional wireless radio systems.\n\nSee Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25\n\nDigicomm Deal Signals Taara's Play for Scaled, High-Speed Wireless Internet\n\nIn May, Taara partnered with Digicomm International, a major telecom equipment supplier, to help deploy its Lightbridge system at scale. Digicomm announced that it will deliver Taara’s Lightbridge to broadband providers, businesses, and municipalities seeking fast, high-capacity wireless internet.\n\nWired describes Taara as a high-speed, earthbound alternative to Starlink, one that's already shown success at events like Coachella and in cities where laying fiber is cost-prohibitive. Whether the federal government will see Lightbridge as a worthy investment remains to be seen, but Alphabet is clearly placing a bet on the future of middle-mile infrastructure.\n\nRead Next: Are you rich?

          "title": "Trump Says Drug Tariffs Probable by Aug. 1, Downplays More Deals",
          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he was likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month and that levies on semiconductors could come soon as well, suggesting that those import taxes could hit alongside broad “reciprocal” rates set for implementation on Aug. 1.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\n“Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff,” Trump told reporters Tuesday as he returned to Washington after attending an artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh.\n\nTrump also said his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors was “similar” and that it was “less complicated” to impose levies on chips, without providing additional detail.\n\nAt a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said he planned to impose a 50% tariff on copper in the coming weeks, and that he expected pharmaceutical tariffs to grow as high as 200% after giving companies a year to bring manufacturing back to the US. Trump has already announced investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on drugs, arguing a flood of foreign imports was threatening national security.\n\nStill, any tariffs could immediately impact drugmakers like Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. that produce drugs overseas — and risks driving up costs for US consumers. So does Trump’s plans for semiconductor tariffs, which are expected to hit not only the chips themselves but popular products like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronic Co. laptops and smartphones.\n\nThe threat came as Trump in recent days has sent letters to a number of trading partners unilaterally dictating the rates for tariffs on many imports — while maintaining he would continue to carry out negotiations. Earlier Tuesday, Trump announced an agreement with Indonesia reducing the 32% rate announced in one of the letters to 19%. Indonesia agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets as part of the agreement, the US said.\n\nTrump on Tuesday predicted that he could strike “two or three” trade deals with countries before implementing his so-called reciprocal tariffs before they are implemented on Aug. 1, saying that an agreement with India was among the most likely.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump told reporters the US was engaged in substantive discussions with between five and six countries, but that he wasn’t necessarily inclined to finalize agreements over simply dictating a tariff rate.\n\n“I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” Trump said.\n\nThe president also said that he was likely to impose a standard tariff of “probably a little over 10%” on smaller countries that did not receive tailored rates.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump said representatives from the European Union — which faces a 30% tariff — would be meeting with US negotiators this week. After returning from Pittsburgh, Trump said that while some countries had indicated a willingness to “open” trade after his threats — including South Korea — others, like Japan, had not.\n\nTrump also dismissed concerns that his threat earlier in the week to impose “secondary” tariffs on Russian trading partners if Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine could impact US consumers, even as experts warned the president risked driving up energy costs with his plan.\n\n“I don’t think so. I think that whole thing is going to go away,” Trump said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget DOGE.

          "title": "Stocks Fade as Expectations are Trimmed for Fed Rate Cut in September",
          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Tuesday closed down -0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.98%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.13%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.50%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) were unchanged.\n\nStock indexes rallied early Tuesday due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +5 bp, and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks. Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was undercut by negative breadth with 26 of the 30 stocks showing declines, led by American Express (AXP), Home Depot (HD), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Merck (MRK).\n\nTuesday's CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was partly driven by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs in the CPI report of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May's +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May's +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12.\" Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is \"all part of a mosaic\" in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nThere was also some positive trade news after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, US imports from Indonesia, totaling around $2.8 billion, will face a US tariff of 19%, which is likely to raise the price that US consumers pay for Indonesian goods.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent negative US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.  Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nTuesday's July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June's level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD) fell -3% Tuesday after the House failed to approve a procedural vote to begin consideration of three bills backed by the crypto industry.  Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which may promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets during the remainder of this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May. Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports on Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday closed mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.31%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Tuesday fell -14.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +5.2 bp to 4.485%.  T-note prices were undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 58% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate rose to a 4.75-month high and ended the day up +1.0 bp at 2.414%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued Tuesday, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed's independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Fed Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition. Mr. Powell's term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May 2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell's term ends in May 2026, or earlier, \"for cause,\" based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed's building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.712%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.5 bp to 4.625%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks generally closed higher on Tuesday, except for Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA), which closed more than -1% lower.  Apple (AAPL) closed slightly higher after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp.\n\nIn Tesla (TSLA) news, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla's top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks showed some strength Tuesday, and helped keep the Nasdaq 100 index in positive territory, after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than +4%.  Arm Holdings (ARM) rose more than +2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed lower on Tuesday as bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -3% on the failure of the House to approve a procedural vote to consider crypto-friendly bills.  Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell more than -3%, and Mara Holdings (MARA) fell by more than -2%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell -1.9%, and Coinbase (COIN) fell -1.5%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) fell by more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell -0.7% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners traded lower after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) fell -3%, and Southern Copper (SCCO) fell -2.4%.\n\nEarnings Reports

          "content": "STORY: U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow dropping about one percent, the S&P 500 shedding four-tenths of a percent, but the Nasdaq ticked up nearly two-tenths of a percent.\n\nIt was the fourth session out of five that the technology-heavy Nasdaq posted a record close.\n\nAI-chip leader Nvidia was the primary factor. Its shares jumped 4% after the company unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China, explained Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance.\n\n\"As we know, Nvidia is the highest-valued stock in the market in the world, north of $4 trillion. So, when Nvidia moves sharply higher, which it is today, that in and of itself can move the Nasdaq. But Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, which are now over 500, those tech stocks are back in control for sure, and that is what's moving the market today.\"\n\nThe news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer gaining nearly six-and-a-half and seven percent, respectively.

          "content": "Apple (AAPL) is in focus after announcing a $500 million deal to buy rare earth magnets from MP Materials (MP) as investors weigh CEO Tim Cook's role as the iPhone maker lags its Big Tech peers in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nCreative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin sits down with Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to take a closer look at the latest from Apple.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nApple saying say it's going to invest $500 million into MP materials as a long-time apple watcher. You saw that and thought what?\n\n00:09 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I think it's it makes a lot of sense, right? Apple has taken every opportunity through the history of this company dating back to even you know the iPod where they've built, uh, bought storage and memory up in bulk again because memory prices of those things can fluctuate. So I think anytime that you can come in and buy in bulk something that gives you a fixed price that you know you can control that pricing for yourselves going forward, um, they're going to make that investment every time, right? In this term, right, whatever rare earths they need in order to manufacture, right, whether that's parts of product or batteries or whatever that is. Those are the things that they'll secure up if they can, and it makes a lot of sense because again, in supply chain management and being able to keep costs down, that's a very strategic move.\n\n00:52 Speaker A\n\nLet's stick with Cook. You saw how those analysts made some waves put out a note provocative at least and maybe it's time for a change in the C suite. What did you make of that?\n\n01:00 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I mean, I think the sentiment is really just coming from, you know, wanting to see more modern leaders or people who are coming up through the ranks that haven't been there or might bring a fresh take to the business. And I think again, right, the reality is if there was somebody better, like if Tim Cook or others thought that there was somebody better within Apple to run and move this company forward, I think they would make that change. Like I don't think this is a matter of pride or um, you know, or stubbornness. I think this is he's still the right guy. The investors believe he's the right guy. The board believes the right guy. And in fact, I believe a lot of the executives believe that he's the right guy. And so I think that's a key part of them keeping him in position. But now this again comes back to a new era of execution, which again, he is now seeing overseeing more of those businesses.\n\n01:44 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, I saw reported he is Cook is staying put on this on the question of Apple and AI Ben. Investors, there are investors who are disappointed with where they're at. You can see that in in the stock and how it's reacted so far this year, we're down about nearly 20%. What do you make of that? How do you think about Apple's role in this AI market right now?\n\n02:07 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I mean, I think one of the best ways to just understand, I think where we're going here is is more not in every one technology or one winner's going to win everything here. You know, I think people like to bucket OpenAI or Google or others and say like these are the ones that are going to win, like this isn't a winner take all market, right? And that's in today's era of just querying right chat GPT or Gemini to do some search. We're moving to an era which is far more agentic, right, which means that you're going to have an agent, that agent is going to work on your behalf, and it's going to understand, you know, you Josh, your preferences, your likes, you're where you're at in the world, your location, like intimate levels of details of you and then go work with other agents, Google's agents, Amazon agents, Meta's agent, etc. So you'll have this one thing and all those agents will have domain expertise. And I think Apple's goal is to have domain expertise again on the customer on their ecosystem. And that's something that they can easily do, right? They don't need to boil the ocean. They can partner with OpenAI or Gemini if you just want to search the internet. But the key is having a smart, intelligent, and intimate agent that knows you that can go and work on your behalf for actions, do predictive things, do things on your behalf. And I think that's their broader strategy, and it's just doing what they can do well, which is create a much more agent or much more friendly customer experience when it comes to AI.\n\n03:27 Speaker A\n\nAnd can they get this done in house in Cupertino Ben? Or and I ask you because I've had analysts come on the show and tell me, it is time for Apple to bring out the checkbook. They're going to have to make a big deal, a big AI deal. I had one analyst tell me it should be perplexity. Um, that would you know, historically Apple Apple does deals, but they're they're smaller. I think the biggest one they ever had was biggest ever was beats for three billion. Um, what do you make of that line of questioning?\n\n04:02 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, I'd say there's two things, right? Apple always doesn't just look at technology, they look at culture. Is this a cultural fit? So that's also a question you've got to ask is who could they buy that fits into the broader culture of Apple. But I think, you know, again, I like Perplexity. I use Perplexity. They're a little bit of a different company. You still need a big foundational model even if you're using perplexity. So that doesn't entirely solve Apple's problems. I think there's actually some smaller acquisitions that can be made. You know, you pointed out Mark German actually said that Mistral is being looked at, which is a large foundational model. I think that would make a ton of sense. And there really are a lot of startups coming out of the valley doing really interesting things, and some of those teams and those individuals in their technology might be a better fit for Apple. But again, I think they don't necessarily need this big world internet foundational model. I think if they've got this agent that's got domain expertise, and that's about their ecosystem, their software, you the customer, and your preferences, and that agent can go work with other agents, which is how the world we're moving to an agentic AI. I think they have everything they need to do on that vision. The question is do they want to do more than that?

Kelley and executive producer J.J. Abrams and based on the New York Times bestselling novel of the same name by Scott Turow. Starring Gyllenhaal in the lead role of chief deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich, the series takes viewers on a gripping journey through the horrific murder that upends the Chicago Prosecuting Attorney’s office when one of its own is suspected of the crime.

When the cataclysmic threat to humanity is revealed to them, they must work together in a test of both their physical and mental strength to keep the secret in the gorge before it’s too late.\n\n\"Pachinko\"\n\nEpic in scope and intimate in tone, the story begins with a forbidden love and crescendos into a sweeping saga that journeys between Korea, Japan and America to tell an unforgettable story of war and peace, love and loss, triumph and reckoning.\n\n\"Your Friends & Neighbors\"\n\nAfter being fired in disgrace, a hedge fund manager still grappling with his recent divorce, resorts to stealing from his neighbors’ homes in the exceedingly affluent Westmont Village, only to discover that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined.\n\n\"Deaf President Now!\"\n\nThe story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of. \"Deaf President Now!\" recounts the eight days of historic protests held at Gallaudet University in 1988 after the school’s board of trustees appointed a hearing president over several very qualified Deaf candidates. After a week of rallies, boycotts and protests, the students of Gallaudet University triumph as the hearing president resigns and beloved dean Dr. I. King Jordan becomes the university’s first Deaf president. The protests marked a pivotal moment in civil rights history, with an impact that extended well beyond the Gallaudet campus, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \"Deaf President Now!\" features exclusive interviews with the five key figures of the movement, including the DPN4 — Jerry Covell, Bridgetta Bourne-Firl, Tim Rarus and Greg Hlibok — alongside I. King Jordan, as well as archival and scripted elements. The film also incorporates an experimental narrative approach called Deaf Point of View, using impressionistic visual photography and intricate sound design to thrust the audience into the Deaf experience.\n\n\"Bono: Stories of Surrender\"\n\n\"Bono: Stories of Surrender\" is a vivid reimagining of Bono’s critically acclaimed one-man stage show, \"Stories of Surrender: An Evening of Words, Music and Some Mischief…\" As he pulls back the curtain on a remarkable life and the family, friends and faith that have challenged and sustained him, he also reveals personal stories about his journey as a son, father, husband, activist and rock star. Along with never-before-seen, exclusive footage from the tour, the film features Bono performing many of the iconic U2 songs that have shaped his life and legacy.\n\n\"Dark Matter\"\n\nHailed as one of the best sci-fi novels of the decade, \"Dark Matter\" is a story about the road not taken. The series will follow Jason Dessen (played by Joel Edgerton), a physicist, professor and family man who — one night while walking home on the streets of Chicago — is abducted into an alternate version of his life. Wonder quickly turns to nightmare when he tries to return to his reality amid the mind-bending landscape of lives he could have lived. In this labyrinth of realities, he embarks on a harrowing journey to get back to his true family and save them from the most terrifying, unbeatable foe imaginable: himself.\n\nAll programs are currently streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nApple TV+ offers premium, compelling drama and comedy series, feature films, groundbreaking documentaries, and kids and family entertainment, and is available to watch across all your favorite screens.

          "content": "Meta (NASDAQ:META) is about to light up Prometheus, its first one-gigawatt AI supercluster, in 2026. Mark Zuckerberg says they're pouring in hundreds of billions of dollars and hiring top talent to build superintelligence infrastructure.\n\nPrometheus will run on half a million Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) GB200 and GB300 GPUs, and it's just the first of several multi-gigawatt clusters. The next one, Hyperion, is designed to scale up to five gigawatts over time, enough compute to cover a chunk of Manhattan.\n\nOwning this much AI horsepower gives Meta an edge in training advanced models and pushing toward artificial general intelligence. By recruiting experts from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), OpenAI and Scale AI, Meta Superintelligence Labs will have more compute per researcher than anyone else.\n\nWith deep pockets, industry-leading hardware and high-profile hires, Meta is staking its claim in the AI arms race. If these clusters deliver as promised, they could redefine what superintelligent systems can achieve.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the nation’s auto safety regulator will argue on Wednesday that the agency must actively oversee self-driving vehicle technology, a potential sign of a tougher approach than some critics expected.\n\nJonathan Morrison, chief counsel of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the first Trump administration, will testify to the U.S. Senate that autonomous vehicles offer potential benefits but also unique risks.\n\n\"NHTSA cannot sit back and wait for problems to arise with such developing technologies, but must demonstrate strong leadership,\" Morrison said in written testimony seen by Reuters.\n\nThe comments suggested NHTSA will continue to closely scrutinize self-driving vehicles. Some critics of the technology had expressed alarm over NHTSA staff cuts this year under a cost-cutting campaign led by Elon Musk, who was a close adviser to Trump and is CEO of self-driving automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe Musk-Trump alliance prompted some critics to speculate that NHTSA would go easy on self-driving vehicle developers. But the relationship began to unravel in late May over Trump’s spending plans, and the two are now locked in a feud.\n\nNHTSA said last month it was seeking information from Tesla about social media videos of robotaxis and self-driving cars Tesla was testing in Austin, Texas. The videos were alleged to show one of the vehicles using the wrong lane and another speeding.\n\nSince October, NHTSA has been investigating 2.4 million Tesla vehicles with full self-driving technology after four reported collisions, including a 2023 fatal crash.\n\n\"The technical and policy challenges surrounding\n\nthese new technologies must be addressed,\" Morrison’s testimony said. \"Failure to do so will result in products that the public\n\nwill not accept and the agency will not tolerate.\"\n\nOther companies in the self-driving sector also were subjects of NHTSA investigations including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Waymo, which last year faced reports its robotaxis may have broken traffic laws. Waymo in May recalled 1,200 self-driving vehicles, and the probe remains open.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny increased after 2023 when a pedestrian was seriously injured by a GM Cruise self-driving car.\n\nThe first recorded death of a pedestrian related to self-driving technology was in 2018 in Tempe, Arizona.",

On July 11, Citigroup maintained a Buy rating for the stock, while raising its price target to $123 from $100, which reflects an anticipation of continued upside potential, adding to the 81% year-to-date gains already in 2025.Citigroup Hikes Roblox Corporation (RBLX)'s Price Target To $123, Maintains Buy Rating\n\nA person taking lessons through Roblox Education, expanding their knowledge and skills.\n\nThe analysts cited robust second-quarter user data from RoMonitor and a favorable verdict on App Store fees as the reason behind the revision. They also highlighted the surge Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) has had since May after the announcement of Q1 FY25 results, with the market now pricing in an annual EBITDA of approximately $880 million.\n\nCitigroup expects April’s court ruling requiring Apple to allow third-party payments to be a major tailwind for Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX).

          "title": "Stocks Fade as Expectations are Trimmed for Fed Rate Cut in September",
          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) on Tuesday closed down -0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview]) (DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) closed down -0.98%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) closed up +0.13%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) fell -0.50%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) were unchanged. \n\nStock indexes rallied early Tuesday due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +5 bp, and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks. \n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was undercut by negative breadth with 26 of the 30 stocks showing declines, led by American Express (AXP [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AXP/overview]), Home Depot (HD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HD/overview]), UnitedHealth (UNH [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UNH/overview]), and Merck (MRK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRK/overview]).\n\nTuesday's CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was partly driven by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs in the CPI report of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May's +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May's +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12.\" Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is \"all part of a mosaic\" in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nThere was also some positive trade news after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, US imports from Indonesia, totaling around $2.8 billion, will face a US tariff of 19%, which is likely to raise the price that US consumers pay for Indonesian goods. \n\nStocks have been undercut by recent negative US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.  Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nTuesday's July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June's level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) fell -3% Tuesday after the House failed to approve a procedural vote to begin consideration of three bills backed by the crypto industry.  Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which may promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets during the remainder of this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May. Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports on Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research. \n\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday closed mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.31%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) on Tuesday fell -14.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +5.2 bp to 4.485%.  T-note prices were undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 58% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate rose to a 4.75-month high and ended the day up +1.0 bp at 2.414%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued Tuesday, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed's independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Fed Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition. Mr. Powell's term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May 2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell's term ends in May 2026, or earlier, \"for cause,\" based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed's building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.712%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.5 bp to 4.625%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks generally closed higher on Tuesday, except for Meta Platforms (META [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/META/overview]) and Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]), which closed more than -1% lower.  Apple (AAPL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/overview]) closed slightly higher after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp. \n\nIn Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]) news, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla's top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks showed some strength Tuesday, and helped keep the Nasdaq 100 index in positive territory, after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMD/overview]) rose more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NVDA/overview]) rose more than +4%.  Arm Holdings (ARM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ARM/overview]) rose more than +2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed lower on Tuesday as bitcoin (^BTCUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) fell -3% on the failure of the House to approve a procedural vote to consider crypto-friendly bills.  Riot Platforms (RIOT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/RIOT/overview]) fell more than -3%, and Mara Holdings (MARA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MARA/overview]) fell by more than -2%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MSTR/overview]) fell -1.9%, and Coinbase (COIN [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/COIN/overview]) fell -1.5%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BLK/overview]) fell by more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations. \n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/JPM/overview]) fell -0.7% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners traded lower after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products. Freeport McMoRan (FCX [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/FCX/overview]) fell -3%, and Southern Copper (SCCO [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SCCO/overview]) fell -2.4%. \n\nEARNINGS REPORTS (7/16/2025)\n\nPrologis Inc (PLD), Progressive Corp/The (PGR), M&T Bank Corp (MTB), PNC Financial

          "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on ASML Holding on FluentInQuality's Substack. As of 14ᵗʰ July, ASML Holding's share was trading at $806.73. ASML's trailing and forward P/E were 31.15 and 30.21 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.Jim Cramer Notes ASML Holding (ASML)'s \"Last Couple Quarters Have Been Weak\"\n\nA technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines.\n\nASML is not a chipmaker; it builds the machines that make the most advanced chips possible, forming the invisible foundation of modern computing. It monopolizes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the cutting-edge process essential for fabricating next-gen semiconductors. No company can match ASML’s precision, which operates at a nanoscopic scale using 13.5nm light, space-grade ZEISS mirrors, and billionth-of-a-meter alignment. With zero real competitors, ASML stands as a gatekeeper to the global chip supply chain, enabling products from NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, Intel, and TSMC. Without ASML, advanced chips—and by extension AI, data centers, and national defense infrastructure—cannot be built.\n\nIts EUV tools sell for over $200 million each, but due to limited supply and overwhelming demand, ASML allocates rather than sells, maintaining a multi-year backlog. The firm’s moat is fortified by thousands of patents, irreplaceable suppliers, and two decades of lead time, making it effectively impossible to replicate even with unlimited capital. While capital intensive, ASML is extremely capital efficient, boasting near-50% gross margins, industry-leading returns, and consistent free cash flow that funds buybacks and dividends.\n\nEach new lithography node increases ASPs and deepens customer lock-in. As chips become more complex, demand for ASML’s precision rises—cementing it as a growing bottleneck in an increasingly consolidated industry. Its next leap, High NA EUV, is already underway. As the only Western firm producing such advanced lithography, ASML is also a geopolitical asset—banned in China, protected by allies. It doesn’t chase trends like AI or edge computing; it enables them. ASML is a fortress built on physics.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on ASML Holding N.V. by Monopolistic Investor in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in EUV lithography, disciplined pricing strategy, and strong government backing. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 8.06% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. Monopolistic Investor shares an identical view but emphasizes ASML’s geopolitical and technological indispensability.\n\nASML Holding is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 80 hedge fund portfolios held ASML at the end of first quarter which was 86 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

          "title": "The attacks on Tim Cook are half-baked—despite Apple stumbling over AI",
          "content": "Apple received an unwanted spotlight last week when President Trump’s trade advisor, Peter Navarro, attacked CEO Tim Cook for not moving manufacturing out of China fast enough. In fact, having received similar pressure during Trump’s first term, Apple, in terms of what it sells in the U.S., now makes most iPhones in India and most laptops, AirPods, and other devices in Vietnam. Furthermore, Cook has committed over $500 billion to new U.S. manufacturing facilities and design centers that will employ about 20,000 Americans.\n\nNevertheless, by late last week attention had quickly shifted to Cook’s tenure as CEO.\n\nPart of this may be seasonal. There is often debate during the hot midsummer months—after annual shareholder meetings—over whether CEO is turnover increasing or decreasing. CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla has said that one factor behind this is an effort to create headlines during the “tape slump” of major business news. He suggested this behavior was behind a recent report by respected analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone at Lightshed calling for Apple to consider replacing Cook amidst Apple’s struggles with artificial intelligence.\n\nWe believe that such short-sighted attacks on an icon of American industry could not be more misguided. Cook’s leadership is still critically needed at Apple.\n\nApple and AI\n\nWhile Apple hasn’t been a first mover in AI, it doesn’t need to be. In fact, it might benefit the company to not get sucked into the AI arms race amidst counterproductive and desperate moves from competitors—consider Meta offering cash bonuses of up to $100 million to poach AI engineers from rivals.\n\nAt our Yale CEO Summit last month, nearly 50% of CEOs polled believe that AI hype has already led to significant overinvestment within their companies. An equal proportion think that AI investments have been allocated inefficiently and profess disappointment with the return on investment.\n\nWhile nobody doubts the importance of AI to Apple’s future, a critical management skill is finding the right balance on the make vs. buy tradeoff. Developing products in-house is not the only way to go. Despite Apple’s setbacks with Apple Intelligence, a potential partnership or outright acquisition of Perplexity could transform Apple into an AI leader practically overnight, as noted by many savvy analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives.\n\nThere are many examples of companies successfully buying or partnering their way into new products or business lines: IBM’s visionary acquisition of RedHat in 2019 gave it a foothold in cloud computing—now a core business. Pfizer’s partnership with BioNTech during the pandemic allowed for the rapid production of the COVID vaccine. Merck’s acquisition of Schering-Plough brought in the blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, which now powers about half of its sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTransforming Apple\n\nDespite Apple’s AI stumbles, Cook deserves a long leash as one of the most revered chief executives of our time, with an unparalleled track record of accomplishment. A genuine tech visionary, he faced the daunting and unenviable task of succeeding the larger-than-life Steve Jobs. He assumed the reins with a rare blend of energy and humility, inspiring others to innovate without any personal grandiosity, transforming Apple into the world’s most valuable company.\n\nUnder Cook’s stewardship, Apple’s market value has soared from $350 billion in 2011 to more than $3 trillion today. Apple became the first U.S. company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2018, doubling that figure in 2020 and tripling it just three years later.\n\nDespite the echo-chamber accusations that Cook is nothing more than a supply chain guru and not a true product visionary, the truth is that Cook’s tenure has seen Apple revolutionize its product lineup, driving profound advancements for the iPhone, Mac, and iPad and introducing industry-leading devices such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple Vision Pro. His leadership has also expanded the Apple ecosystem, launching services like Apple Pay, which is growing every year, as well as Apple Music and Apple TV+.\n\nDespite this unparalleled record of achievement, even supporters of Cook wonder if he may have lost his touch or his creativity. Though strongly supporting Cook, CNBC anchor David Faber wondered aloud, “sometimes, as people get older, they may not be taking in as much information, or their expertise may be in an area that is no longer as specific to needs of their business, and I’m curious as to whether there is somebody else out there who might be in a better position to do that.”\n\nLong leadership\n\nThe first author of this essay has closely studied age and work—once called industrial gerontology—since the founding of the field decades ago, and my bookThe Hero’s Farewell: What Happens when CEOs Retire provided the first empirical studies of leaders in late career. There is no correspondence between age and invention, or age and leadership.\n\nOver 45 years of research on age and work, I have closely documented the effects of age and found potentially surprising results. Older workers tend to have greater sales skills and interpersonal savvy, with only modest declines in physical dexterity. Research on age and risk in engineering found that older managers were only mildly less willing to take risks. They took longer to make decisions, but they were better able to appreciate the value of new information.\n\nConsider some of the startling examples through history. Benjamin Franklin helped draft the Declaration of Independence at 70, invented bifocal glasses in his late 70s, and negotiated an agreement to salvage the Constitutional Convention at 81. France relied upon Charles De Gaulle to unify the nation while he was in his late sixties and seventies. Averell Harriman, after leading Union Pacific and Brown Brothers Harriman, served as one of America’s greatest diplomats, unofficially advising presidents until his nineties.\n\nCompared to these examples, at age 64, Cook is just getting started.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some steps Cook can take to strengthen Apple’s positioning, even beyond doubling down on AI development. As CNBC’s Jim Cramer pointed out, it would not hurt with the Trump administration if Apple accelerated some of its $500 billion commitment for domestic manufacturing. Moving some spending forward and accelerating that planned four-year timeline would be a tangible political and patriotic signal to rectify Trump’s fears that he is being played via delays and long timeframes. Similarly, it may not hurt Apple to add a respected technologist with AI, software, or hardware expertise to its board.\n\nBut clearly, Apple has stayed ripe for growth and product innovation under Cook, and the attacks on him and the company are half-baked.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nRead more:\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has created more shareholder value than Steve Jobs. But suddenly his weaknesses are on display in the AI era Don’t count out Apple in the ‘AI race’: It might be in the best position of all Apple’s AI efforts ‘have struck midnight,’ and the only way it can stop getting further behind is acquiring Perplexity, analyst Dan Ives says Apple is facing a ‘fork in the road year’ on AI, but has one clear advantage, analysts say\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just made a $500 million move that could reshape the rare-earth supply chainand investors are taking notice of MP Materials (NYSE:MP). Under a new multiyear deal, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will source U.S.-made rare-earth magnets from MP starting in 2027, as part of its broader strategy to reduce reliance on China. These magnets are key components inside iPhones and other devicespowering things like the haptic engine and internal microphones. MP will produce the magnets in Texas, using recycled materials processed at a new California facility, both part of a vertically integrated supply chain that Apple hopes can withstand future geopolitical shocks.\n\nFor context, China has long dominated global rare-earth magnet production. But that dominance has come under pressure, especially after Beijing imposed export controls last spring in response to U.S. tariffs. That move caused a scramble among Western manufacturers and led to supply chain reevaluations across the tech industry. Apple, already under political pressure from former President Trump to bring more of its operations back to the U.S., appears to be responding with more tangible stepsstarting with this agreement. According to MP's SEC filing, Apple will make a $200 million prepayment, a rare move that signals commitment from both sides.\n\nThis shift also aligns with Apple's previously announced plan to spend $500 billion in the U.S. over four years. While analysts at Bank of America suggest much of that was already planned, the MP deal suggests Apple could be reallocating spending from other regions into strategic domestic capacity. Though the company continues expanding in India and Vietnam, this magnet supply agreement may signal that Apple sees long-term risk in depending on China for mission-critical inputs. And for MP, this could be a breakout momentcementing its role as a key supplier for one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

When every second counts and precise location awareness matters, Mapbox equips Watch Duty to reach users with actionable information using maps optimized for speed, clarity, and accessibility.\n\n\"Our mission is to serve everyone, including people who might be unfamiliar with using maps, with clear and up-to-date location information during emergencies,\" said John Mills, CEO of Watch Duty. \"Mapbox gives us the tools to build fast, intuitive maps that just work — even when usage spikes and the stakes are high.\"\n\nThe Critical Importance of Clear, Customized Map Design Initially built with open-source tools, Watch Duty switched to Mapbox basemaps and geocoding for its superior performance and design flexibility. Mapbox excels at satisfying highly specific design requirements, even the finer details such as using the correct, locally-recognized road shield icons across different states so that users can easily recognize roads when interpreting the map and planning evacuation routes.\n\n\"Doing things like getting the highway interstate signs right was impossible on our earliest versions built with Esri, Leaflet, and OpenStreetMap. With Mapbox, we can customize our map design however we need to,\" said Mills. \"Watch Duty is all about user experience, because during a disaster, our map has to be easy to use. Mapbox is the only map provider that seems to get this.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nMapbox also provides unmatched control over the order, styling, and visibility of map layers — giving Watch Duty the ability to preserve map legibility even while displaying numerous overlapping layers showing evacuation zones, fire perimeters, power outages, red flag weather warnings, and more. Using the Mapbox Studio map styling interface, the Watch Duty engineers can more efficiently collaborate with designers to fine-tune the basemap styling.\n\n\"The map style editor in Mapbox Studio is an incredible tool,\" said Dave Merritt, CTO of Watch Duty. \"Watch Duty has so many map layers, the overall visual clarity of our map styles is essential. Mapbox Studio allows for a lot more design exploration and ultimately a much more usable and accessible product, which are key tenets for Watch Duty.\"\n\nFrom Maplibre to Mapbox: Performance That Scales After encountering challenges with adding features and fixing bugs when using the open source mapping software Maplibre, Watch Duty migrated to the latest version of Mapbox GL JS, using Capacitor to serve the app on both web and mobile platforms. Building with the Mapbox map renderer has improved map performance and enables easier maintenance and feature development for the Watch Duty engineers.\n\n\"Watch Duty migrated from Maplibre GL to Mapbox GL JS because we needed a more usable, robust mapping platform,\" said Merritt. \"Our migration was fast, and the performance gains have been immediate.\"\n\nThe expanded partnership between Mapbox and Watch Duty includes ongoing collaboration to further enhance the performance and design of Watch Duty's maps based on continued feedback from public and first responders.\n\nBuilding for Unpredictable Demand with a Predictable Partner Watch Duty experiences rapid, large-scale usage surges during wildfire events. Ensuring reliable performance during spikes is a challenge for any application and developer team, but especially critical during emergencies. The Mapbox platform provides the reliability that Watch Duty requires to be able to serve millions of requests per second.\n\n\"Free open source software alone would never be enough to do what we're doing, at the level of demand that we serve,\" said Mills. \"Having a technology partner like Mapbox means that we are able to scale with confidence and keep providing this critical service to the public.\"\n\nThe partnership ensures that Watch Duty can continue offering the best map experience to its users. It also engages the geospatial engineering expertise of Mapbox developers to rapidly resolve issues and co-develop valuable new features to support emergency response and wildfire safety.\n\n\"Watch Duty has an incredible attention to detail and they raise the bar on the life-saving assistance they provide to so many communities across the US. The Mapbox team is excited to partner with their innovative team,\" said Wong. \"Mapbox product teams and engineers drive geospatial innovation for our customers every day, but it is a special honor to support an application that helps to keep so many people safe.\"\n\nAbout Watch Duty Watch Duty is a nonprofit organization that delivers real-time emergency information to the public. Powered by a network of volunteers, firefighters, dispatchers, and technologists, its mission is to ensure that communities receive accurate and timely emergency information about wildfires through alerts when they need it most.

          "title": "Nvidia’s Huang Wins China Reprieve in Rare Trade War Reversal",
          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s Jensen Huang spent months telling everyone what a grave mistake the US was making restricting shipments of artificial intelligence processors to China — with little sign that his argument was swaying anyone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\nThen, very suddenly, that all changed.\n\nLate on Monday, the chipmaker said it received assurances that the US government would allow it to export some chips to the Asian nation. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia’s chief rival, quickly followed with a similar announcement. These export license approvals could generate billions of dollars in total revenue for the companies this year — and they mark a dramatic reversal after the Trump administration said the issue wasn’t even up for debate.\n\nHuang has taken almost every opportunity available to him — from the stage of tech events to Washington visits — to argue that a crackdown on China is counterproductive. During his appearances, he navigated a fine line between praising Trump policies aimed at bringing back chip manufacturing to the US and demanding more freedom to do business in China.\n\nJust last week, Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House.\n\n“Jensen has done a wonderful job at advocating to the administration,” said Matthew Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. The CEO has catered to the White House’s interest in investing in the US, “while at the same time advocating his views on the importance that US AI should flow freely,” he said.\n\nWhen Nvidia announced its plans to reenter the China market, Huang was visiting Beijing, attending a government-sponsored event and meeting officials to discuss “safe and secure AI for the benefit of all,” according to a company statement. Nvidia said it was assured that licenses would be granted by the US government and “hopes to start deliveries soon.”\n\n“It is a positive signal not only for Nvidia and its related supply chain but also for broader markets given its implications for US-China trade talks,” said Richard Clode, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nStill, there’s no guarantee the new approvals will lead to flourishing business in China. Nvidia and AMD aren’t certain how many chips the new export licenses will cover or how long they will last, according to a person familiar with the matter. In China, the US chipmakers are only permitted to sell older, limited versions of their products. And many buyers in the country, where companies are rapidly churning out AI models, have moved to local suppliers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt’s also not clear how much Huang’s lobbying turned the tide. The concession was part of broader US negotiations with China, which the White House said will accept higher tariffs and cooperate on rare-earth minerals.\n\n“Senior administration officials are pretty clearly characterizing this as having been explicitly traded for what we got in those talks,” said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.\n\nHuang has argued that restrictions in China mean American chipmakers will cede the immense market to local rivals, chiefly Huawei Technologies Co. White House AI adviser David Sacks has echoed that, calling for an American “tech stack” — a set of complementary hardware and software services that the nation can export and control. Sacks, a tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist, was critical in reversing recent semiconductor restrictions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, arguing that the Gulf powerhouses would otherwise turn to China for their growing AI ambitions.\n\n“We are not selling the latest and greatest chips to China,” Sacks said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. “The policy is nuanced, and it makes a lot of sense.”\n\nBut there’s another contingent who view chip bans as a key way to keep Beijing from advancing in what’s widely seen as an AI arms race. The abrupt about-face this week came as a shock to many China hawks in the administration and on Capitol Hill, leaving several privately fuming, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nMany policymakers were in the dark on how the changes will be implemented and raced to get a better understanding of the mechanics, said these people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nThe House select committee on China plans to seek clarification from the Commerce Department on the reversal, according to the panel’s Republican chairman, Representative John Moolenaar. “It is crucial that the US maintain its lead” and keeps advanced AI out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, he said in a statement.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the policy change makes sense because Nvidia and AMD won’t be selling their latest chips in the market. “We want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology. They still rely upon it, and that’s key,” he said. “So we try to play that balance. We don’t sell them our best stuff.”\n\nThe US first restricted Nvidia’s sales in China in 2022, placing curbs designed to keep the most advanced AI resources from the Chinese military. In response, Nvidia designed new processors, including the H20. It’s an AI accelerator with certain components — such as memory access — deliberately limited to comply with US bans. Officials under President Joe Biden weighed the idea of placing restrictions on the H20 but ultimately didn’t.\n\nTrump then went ahead with the curbs in April, citing national security concerns.\n\nA month later, Huang said the US government was shooting itself in the foot with the policy. “All in all, the export controls were a failure. The facts would suggest it,” he told reporters in Taipei. He also said demand in China for AI chips would reach $50 billion in 2026 — a market that Trump basically kept his company out of.\n\nNvidia’s products are central to the creation and running of artificial intelligence software. The company has more than a 90% share in AI accelerators — chips that are the key component in giant data centers being built around the world.\n\nAccess to the chips have become a negotiating card for Trump during his trips to the Middle East, where he secured massive pledges from Gulf states to invest in the US. Along the way, he’s praised Huang for going further than some other tech CEOs, such as Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook.\n\nDuring a trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump scanned the crowd for the tech luminaries who joined him for an event.\n\nHe spotted Huang. “Thank you very much, Jensen. I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here. But you are,” the president said. “What a job you’ve done.”\n\n--With assistance from Laura Avetisyan, Brunella Tipismana Urbano and Alicia Diaz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThailand’s Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough Spot The New Third Rail in Silicon Valley: Investing in Chinese AI How Hims Became the King of Knockoff Weight-Loss Drugs ‘The Turbulence Is Brutal’: Four Shark Tank Businesses on Tariffs Will Trade War Make South India the Next Manufacturing Hub?\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US President Donald Trump said he reached a deal with Indonesia that will see goods from the country face a 19% tariff, while US exports will not be taxed.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\n“They are paying 19% and we are not paying anything,” Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House. “We are going to have full access to Indonesia.”\n\nTrump has sent tariff letters over the last week to multiple trading partners, increasing pressure on negotiators ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline for higher duties to take effect. A pact with Indonesia, which was threatened with a 32% tariff, would be the first struck with a country targeted by one of those messages to reduce their rate.\n\nIndonesia also agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets, “many of them 777’s,” Trump said later on social media.\n\n“If there is any Transshipment from a higher Tariff Country, then that Tariff will be added on to the Tariff that Indonesia is paying,” the president added.\n\nMarkets have been in wait-and-see mode on Trump’s trade proclamations, given he has changed rates and deadlines multiple times since he announced country-by-country tariffs on April 2 and then quickly paused them. Boeing shares increased as much as 0.8% on the announcement, while the dollar rose 0.4% on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was little changed after earlier topping 6,300.\n\nTrump initially announced the accord on social media, without providing specifics. He said he dealt directly with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to finalize the deal.\n\nIndonesia is preparing a joint statement with the US that will detail additional information, including non-tariff measures and commercial agreements, Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Secretary Susiwijono Moegiarso said in a text message late Tuesday in Jakarta.\n\nEarlier: Indonesia Touts ‘Sweetener’ as Negotiators Meet US Officials\n\nIndonesia’s top negotiator, Minister Airlangga Hartarto, last week met with US officials, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to hash out an improved agreement.\n\nSoutheast Asia’s largest economy had earlier proposed near-zero tariffs on about 70% of US imports, as well as business deals in critical minerals, energy, agriculture and defense, but that failed to convince Trump to lower the levy on Indonesian goods from the 32% rate he first set back in April.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAn agreement with Indonesia would be the fourth trade framework Trump has announced since pausing his country-specific tariffs, after Vietnam and the UK. The US and China also reached a tariff truce that includes the planned resumption of critical minerals and technology trade between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nThe pacts have thus far fallen short of full-fledged trade deals, with many details left to be negotiated later. Trump provided no paper to back up last week’s claim of a deal with Vietnam. The country’s leadership was caught off guard by Trump’s declaration that Hanoi agreed to a 20% tariff, and the Vietnamese government is still seeking to lower the rate, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEarlier: Apparel Tariffs Outside China: Is Vietnam’s 20% the New Normal?\n\nTrump has kept foreign governments and investors on edge about his tariff agenda, with partners rushing to avoid higher import taxes and markets facing yet another dose of uncertainty. The US president indicated Monday he preferred to stick with the levies in his letters, saying, “I really don’t want deals. I just want the paper to get sent.”\n\nThe president also said he was willing to continue talks with major economies, including the European Union.\n\nTrump over the last week unleashed a barrage of tariff demand letters, informing other economies of new duties set to begin Aug. 1 if they cannot negotiate better terms with the US. The missives extended what was initially a July 9 deadline for another three weeks, setting off another frantic dash of negotiations.\n\nThe slew of tariff threats from Trump have prompted economies to broaden trade ties beyond the US; Indonesia reached a tentative economic agreement with the EU over the weekend.\n\n“There is quite a level of frustration with these deals and more talk about exploring those other options, to include Europe,” said Erin Murphy, senior fellow on emerging Asia economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nSoutheast Asian nations — loathe to choose between the US and China — have long been caught in the middle of economic and political battles between the two superpowers. While Vietnam is said to be further along in trade negotiations with the US, Thailand is in ongoing talks and mulling how to reduce US duties without giving away too much and stoking domestic unrest.\n\nPhilippine officials also are pushing to secure a pact ahead of the new deadline, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. set to visit Washington later this month in an effort to reduce or eliminate Trump’s planned 20% tariff on the island nation.\n\n--With assistance from Grace Sihombing and Claire Jiao.\n\n(Adds markets in sixth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget DOGE.

          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) is unchanged, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +0.51%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.02%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.57%.\n\nStock indexes rallied early the session due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield is currently up +4.8 bp and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks.

by Merck (MRK) and American Express (AXP).\n\nToday’s CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was driven partly by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May’s +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May’s +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news today after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a “very good place” and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants “not to worry about August 12.”  Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is “all part of a mosaic” in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.  Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%. Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don’t relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nToday’s July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June’s level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD) is down -3% today due to some long liquidation pressure following the recent rally on hopes for more favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled, “Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,” which may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May.  Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan’s US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports today include Blackrock, Citigroup, JP Morgan, NY Bank of Mellon, Wells Fargo, and State Street. Key earnings reports Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.31%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -13.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield is up by +4.8 bp at 4.481%.  T-note prices being undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 55% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate today rose to a 4.75-month high and is currently up +1.5 bp at 2.419%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration’s campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued today, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed’s independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition.  Mr. Powell’s term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May-2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell’s term ends in May 2026, or earlier “for cause,” based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed’s building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp at 2.710%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +2.2 bp at 4.622%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are trading higher today, except for Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA).  Apple (AAPL) Apple is up more than +1% after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp.\n\nIn Tesla (TSLA) news today, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla’s top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks are doing well today after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is up more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than +4% on the news.  Arm Holdings (ARM) is up more than +3%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are mixed today as bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -3% on some long liquidation pressure after posting a new record high on Monday. Riot Platforms (RIOT) is down more than -3%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR) is more than -1%, but Coinbase Global (COIN) is up +0.4%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is down more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) is down -0.4% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners are trading lower today after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products.  Freeport McMoRan (FCX) is down more than -4%, and Southern Copper (SCCO) is down more than -3%.\n\nEarnings

          "title": "America's only rare earth producer gets a boost from Apple and Pentagon agreements",
          "content": "MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine, announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple on Tuesday to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of last week’s announcement that the U.S. Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based company. That will make the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials and help increase magnet production.\n\nDespite their name, the 17 rare earth elements aren’t actually rare, but it’s hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.\n\nThey are important ingredients in everything from smartphones and submarines to EVs and fighter jets, and it's those military applications that have made rare earths a key concern in ongoing U.S. trade talks. That's because China dominates the market and imposed new limits on exports after President Donald Trump announced his widespread tariffs. When shipments dried up, the two sides sat down in London.\n\nThe agreement with Apple will allow MP Materials to further expand its new factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce the magnets that make iPhones vibrate. The company expects to start producing magnets for GM's electric vehicles later this year and this agreement will let it start producing magnets for Apple in 2027.\n\nThe Apple agreement represents a tenth of the company's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically during the Trump administration. And although the deal will provide a significant boost for MP Materials, the agreement with the Defense Department may be even more meaningful.\n\nNeha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that the Pentagon's 10-year promise to guarantee a minimum price for the key elements of neodymium and praseodymium will guarantee stable revenue for MP Minerals and protect it from potential price cuts by Chinese producers that are subsidized by their government.\n\n“This is the kind of long-term commitment needed to reshape global rare earth supply chains,\" Mukherjee said.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths. His administration is both helping MP Materials and trying to encourage the development of new mines that would take years to come to fruition. China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply. The fear is that the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements that could disrupt production of a variety of products. MP Materials can't satisfy all of the U.S. demand from its Mountain Pass mine in California’s Mojave Desert.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe deals by MP Materials come as Beijing and Washington have agreed to walk back on their non-tariff measures: China is to grant export permits for rare earth magnets to the U.S., and the U.S. is easing export controls on chip design software and jet engines. The truce is intended to ease tensions and prevent any catastrophic fall-off in bilateral relations, but is unlikely to address fundamental differences as both governments take steps to reduce dependency on each other.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters David Klepper and Didi Tang contributed to this report from Washington D.C.

          "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer Analyzed These 9 Stocks As He Said Tariffs Are Better Than CIA Coups. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a regular feature of Cramer’s morning show. Earlier during the year, the CNBC host defended the stock after shares struggled due to weakness in the Chinese smartphone market. Cramer continued to defend Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after analysts soured on its Siri and perceived AI weakness. He continued to defend the company, and this time, Cramer discussed reports suggesting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook should leave the company:\n\n“[On analysts saying Tim Cook should leave] I wanted to say, I thought it was outrageous. I thought that was outrageous. I wish that I could’ve, that I would love to be able to be Tim Cook and say what I’ve done for the shareholders. And it’s just incredible. The amount of wealth that man has created. I mean that’s like when I saw, at one point today I saw in premarket that NVIDIA was down. I was going to call for Jensen’s firing. . .I mean come on. . .you know Jensen has to go. Can we like stop? Like stop? Like Tim Cook’s great.”Apple Inc. (AAPL): It's \"Outrageous\" To Say Tim Cook Should Leave, Says Jim Cramer\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nCramer discussed key traits for a potential Tim Cook successor earlier. Here is what he said:\n\n“[On Morgan Stanley saying Tim Cook’s successor could benefit from having a hardware background] Well look, it’s funny hardware is part of the, I’m glad you mentioned hardware, hardware’s part of the issue of how NVIDIA got to where it is. This is an essentially, there’s a belief in many people on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, that hardware prevails here because we’re gonna get rid of a huge number of people who would do SaaS, you know, software as a service, and that includes, yes, Salesforce, includes ServiceNow, includes DataDog which got out of the S&P. Because there are going to be fewer and fewer people who are actually in the organization who need that. But that does not mean that you wouldn’t need more Apple.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

          "title": "Why Is Jamf (JAMF) Stock Soaring Today",
          "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of apple device management company, Jamf (NASDAQ:JAMF) jumped 7.2% in the morning session after the company announced it expects to exceed the high end of its second-quarter 2025 guidance and revealed a new strategic reinvestment plan. The Apple device management company now anticipates both revenue and non-GAAP operating income to surpass its previous forecasts. The original guidance for the second quarter, which ended June 30, projected total revenue between $167.5 million and $169.5 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $29.5 million to $30.5 million. In a move to bolster long-term growth, Jamf also announced a strategic plan that includes reducing its workforce by about 6.4% and reallocating resources. The company will increase its focus on enterprise customers and accelerate investments in artificial intelligence. While the restructuring will result in one-time charges of $11.0 million to $12.5 million, investors appear to be focused on the positive outlook and the company's efforts to improve operational efficiency and drive future profitability.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $8.30, up 1% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Jamf? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nJamf’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock dropped 3.9% after a broader market sell-off triggered by renewed trade tensions. U.S. stock indices fell after the Trump administration announced intentions to impose a 35% tariff on many goods imported from Canada.\n\nThis move is far more than a typical trade dispute; it targets the United States' largest and most deeply integrated trading partner. Canada is not merely a neighbor but a critical component of North American supply chains, particularly in sectors like automotive, energy, and critical minerals.\n\nThis move sparked concerns about potential retaliatory actions and a wider impact on the North American economy, leading to a risk-off sentiment among investors. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all opened lower, pulling back from recent record highs and heading for their first weekly loss in three weeks.\n\nJamf is down 41.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.30 per share, it is trading 56.1% below its 52-week high of $18.91 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Jamf’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $211.74.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView Comments",

Traders on Wall Street now largely expecting the Fed to keep rates on hold at its July meeting. Plus, investors are also monitoring earnings from Wall Street's biggest banks. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond said on the company's earnings call that President Trump's trade policies pose quote significant risk to the US economy. He also stressed the importance of Fed independence. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reporting yet another high-level departure at Tesla. Troy Jones, who was Tesla's top sales executive in North America, has departed the EV maker after 15 years at the company. The departure comes as Tesla is facing a steep drop in sales. And MP materials shares surging today after Apple struck a $500 million deal with the company to buy rare earth minerals. Apple said the spending on rare earth minerals is part of its earlier pledge to invest more than $500 billion in the US economy. And that's Yahoo Finance market minute.

          "content": "Stock Market Today: Dow slumps; S&P 500 and Nasdaq rally originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nUpdated 12:29 p.m. EDT\n\nIt's a tale of two markets: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, weighted in favor of the highest-priced stocks, is slumping. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq indexes, weighted in favor of market capitalizations, are higher.\n\nIt's more than that. The Dow has includes six financial stocks, 20% of the total, and they're all lower today:\n\nJP Morgan Chase  (JPM) , Goldman Sachs  (GS) , UnitedHealth Group  (UNH) , Travelers Companies  (TRV) , American Express  (AXP)  and Visa  (V) .\n\nThe winners so far today are techs: Nvidia  (NVDA) , Microsoft  (MSFT) , and Apple  (AAPL)  and the top dog in consumer discretionary stocks: Amazon.com  (AMZN) .\n\nAnd Goldman is the priciest of the Dow stocks at $706, while Amazon, Apple and Nvidia are among the lower-priced stocks. Microsoft is the outlier of the group at $507, up nearly $4.\n\nAt 12:25 ET, the Dow was down 280 points at 44,180. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was 1 point at 6,267, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 126 points at 20,767.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Index was up 111 points to 22,966 after hitting a new high of 23.051.\n\nUpdated 10:18 a.m. EDT\n\nStocks Mixed Early On\n\nIn the first half-hour of trading, the major indexes were mostly higher. We say mostly because the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 87 points, which is actually a small decline on a percentage basis. The blue-chips were at 44,373, off 0.2%.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up a modest eight points to 6,277, but that was after hitting a 52-week high right after the open.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite had added 112 points or 0.5% to 20,753. It also hit a 52-week high soon after the open. Not to be a party pooper, the Nasdaq-100 Index was up 130 points to 22,986 after hitting a new high of 23.051.\n\nNvidia  (NVDA) , Broadcom AVGO and Coinbase  (COIN)  also hit new highs. Bitcoin was off $1,559 to $118,377, a day after hitting a new high of $123,166.\n\nStock market today: The banks weigh in\n\nThis morning's earnings reports are all about the banks.\n\nJP Morgan Chase  (JPM) , BlackRock  (BLK) , Citigroup  (C) , Wells Fargo  (WFC)  and Bank of New York Mellon  (BK)  all reported earnings that topped expectations. As for future statements, not all was rosy, with Wells Fargo guiding lower.\n\nCitigroup is the only one trading higher, gaining as much as 3%, while Wells Fargo is down close to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is the other big news this morning. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that June CPI rose 0.3%, which was in line with expectations.\n\nYear over year, the CPI gained 2.7%. That's faster than May's 2.4% increase. Higher food and energy costs were behind the faster inflation, Bloomberg reported.\n\nCore CPI gained 0.2%, which was better than expected. The core figure was below forecasts for the fifth straight month, the news service reported.US BLS\n\nSo, how are stocks looking this morning?\n\nUp! S&P 500 futures have been rallying since yesterday's close (black line, below) and are up 0.4%.ThinkOrSwim\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is even stronger, gaining 0.7% in premarket trading.ThinkOrSwim\n\nThe long end of the U.S. treasury curve is stronger (yields are down). Gold and crude are lower, while copper is slightly higher.\n\nStock Market Today: Dow slumps; S&P 500 and Nasdaq rally first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 15, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 15, 2025, where it first appeared.\n\nView Comments",

          "text": "News Headline\n\nApple Sued Over Alleged Siri AI Misrepresentations, Investors Advised to Act\n\nNews Condensation\n\nA lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. and its senior executives by the law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP. The lawsuit claims that Apple misled investors about its artificial intelligence (AI) features, specifically regarding Siri's advanced capabilities and the timeline for delivering them in the iPhone 16. The complaint states that Apple did not have a working version of these advanced AI features and misrepresented how long it would take to include them in its devices.\n\nThe truth about these delays surfaced in two key instances:\n*   On 07-03-2025, Apple announced an indefinite delay for several AI-based Siri features. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped by $11.59, nearly 5%, from $239.07 to $227.48 per share.\n*   On 09-06-2025, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) did not feature any new updates on advanced Siri features. Media outlets described the event as \"underwhelming,\" and CNN noted that Apple appeared to be behind competitors in AI. This led to a further stock price decline of $2.47, over 1%, from $203.92 to $201.45 per share.\n\nInvestors who bought Apple shares and experienced losses may have legal options. They are encouraged to contact BFA Law by 19-08-2025 to potentially be a lead plaintiff in the case. There is no upfront cost for investors to participate in this legal action.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nThe lawsuit against Apple for alleged misrepresentation of its AI capabilities, specifically Siri, carries several important implications:\n\n*   Investor Trust Erosion: The core of the lawsuit suggests Apple may have provided misleading information about its technological progress. This can damage investor confidence in the company's forward-looking statements and future innovations.\n*   Financial Repercussions: If found liable, Apple could face significant financial penalties or settlements, impacting its earnings and cash flow. The lawsuit seeks compensation for investors who lost money due to the alleged misrepresentations.\n*   Market Perception of AI Development: The news highlights the challenges and potential for overstatement in the rapidly evolving AI sector. It signals to the broader market that claims of advanced AI features need to be scrutinized, particularly when they influence stock valuations.\n*   Stock Price Volatility: The documented stock price declines on 07-03-2025 (a nearly 5% drop from $239.07 to $227.48) and 09-06-2025 (over 1% drop from $203.92 to $201.45) directly demonstrate how investor disappointment and perceived delays in promised features can negatively impact a company's market value.\n*   Operational Scrutiny: The allegations suggest potential issues within Apple's AI development and integration processes. This could lead to increased internal and external scrutiny of the company's product roadmaps and R&D effectiveness.\n*   Shareholder Rights: This class action serves as an example of how shareholders can seek recourse when they believe a company's management has acted in a way that harms their investments due to false or misleading statements.\n\n2025-07-16T12:19:00+00:00\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/16/3116371/0/en/AAPL-INVESTOR-LOSS-A-Class-Action-was-filed-on-behalf-of-Apple-Inc-NASDAQ-AAPL-Investors-Contact-BFA-Law-by-August-19-if-you-Suffered-Losses.html",

Apple received the highest possible rating of 100% based on its financial strength and stock price relative to its value. This strategy looks for companies that consistently make money over a long period, have little debt, and are reasonably priced. Apple, a large company in the communications equipment sector, passed all nine important tests in this analysis, including its ability to predict earnings, manage debt, generate returns for owners, produce cash, and handle its share buybacks. The report highlights that a score of 90% or above indicates strong interest from this investment method.\n\nAnalysis and Insight\n\n*   The 100% rating for Apple (AAPL) using a Warren Buffett-inspired strategy suggests the company exhibits qualities sought by long-term, value-oriented investors, despite being a prominent growth stock.\n*   Passing all nine fundamental tests indicates Apple's strong financial health and operational discipline across various key areas, including profitability, debt management, and shareholder returns.\n*   This analysis supports the view that Apple possesses predictable earnings, efficient use of capital, and a robust financial structure, aligning with a conservative investment philosophy focused on durable businesses.\n*   For investors, this provides an independent validation that Apple's current fundamentals and valuation are attractive according to a historically successful investment approach known for seeking safe, high-quality businesses.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aapl-factor-based-stock-analysis-warren-buffett-2",

          "text": "J&J Raises Outlook Amid Tariff Concerns; MP Materials Soars on Apple Deal\n\nNews Content\n\nJohnson & Johnson increased its expected full-year profits and sales, causing its stock to rise slightly. However, potential new government taxes on medicines from President Trump are a concern for the company and the entire drug industry. Separately, MP Materials' stock went up significantly after Apple announced a half-billion-dollar deal to buy special magnets from them and work together on a recycling plant in California.\n\nNews Analysis\n\n*   Johnson & Johnson's higher financial forecasts usually indicate strong business performance, which generally boosts investor confidence. However, the looming threat of government taxes on pharmaceutical products creates uncertainty for the entire sector, potentially offsetting some of the positive sentiment from the increased outlook. Companies like Johnson & Johnson will need to address how they plan to manage these potential new costs.\n*   MP Materials' significant deal with Apple highlights the increasing demand for critical rare earth materials, which are essential for advanced technologies.

          "text": "Headline: Apple's AI Lag Cools Investor Interest\n\nNews Content Overview:\nApple is losing appeal among investors as other major technology companies surge ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Despite a widespread increase in tech investments, Apple's stock has trailed behind competitors like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia, which are already providing AI features for consumers. Experts suggest that these rivals have been quicker to release AI applications that deeply engage users. While Apple has historically prioritized data privacy and security, which could become more important in the future of AI, its current slow pace in offering its own AI functions means users are downloading AI apps from other companies onto their Apple devices. This has contributed to a decline in Apple's stock this year, with Nvidia now holding a significantly larger market value. Apple often waits for others to innovate before releasing its own refined products, a strategy that some believe it is employing for AI, especially considering privacy concerns with existing AI offerings.\n\nNews Impact Analysis:\n*   Apple's stock performance is under pressure because it is perceived as falling behind in the race to develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence features for consumers.\n*   Investors are actively reallocating their capital towards tech companies that are demonstrating clear leadership and innovation in AI, causing Apple to lose market share and investor preference relative to its peers.\n*   The market is currently prioritizing immediate AI advancements and visible use cases. Apple's traditional approach of observing initial innovations before releasing its own perfected products is currently seen as a disadvantage, contributing to its stock's underperformance and a significant shift in market capitalization, as exemplified by Nvidia now being $1 trillion larger than Apple.\n*   While Apple's strong focus on user privacy and data security may offer a long-term advantage as AI technologies mature, the company needs to introduce tangible AI functionalities to reignite investor enthusiasm and regain its competitive edge.\n*   For Apple to reverse its stock's decline and recapture investor confidence, it must deliver on its own AI story by launching compelling and integrated AI features, rather than just serving as a platform for others' AI applications.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lags-ai-race-means-103016559.html",

          "content": "Stock Market Today: Dow slumps; S&P 500 and Nasdaq rally originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nUpdated 12:29 p.m. EDT\n\nIt's a tale of two markets: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, weighted in favor of the highest-priced stocks, is slumping. The Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq indexes, weighted in favor of market capitalizations, are higher.\n\nIt's more than that. The Dow has includes six financial stocks, 20% of the total, and they're all lower today:\n\nJP Morgan Chase  (JPM) , Goldman Sachs  (GS) , UnitedHealth Group  (UNH) , Travelers Companies  (TRV) , American Express  (AXP)  and Visa  (V) .\n\nThe winners so far today are techs: Nvidia  (NVDA) , Microsoft  (MSFT) , and Apple  (AAPL)  and the top dog in consumer discretionary stocks: Amazon.com  (AMZN) .\n\nAnd Goldman is the priciest of the Dow stocks at $706, while Amazon, Apple and Nvidia are among the lower-priced stocks. Microsoft is the outlier of the group at $507, up nearly $4.\n\nAt 12:25 ET, the Dow was down 280 points at 44,180. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was 1 point at 6,267, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 126 points at 20,767.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Index was up 111 points to 22,966 after hitting a new high of 23.051.\n\nUpdated 10:18 a.m. EDT\n\nStocks Mixed Early On\n\nIn the first half-hour of trading, the major indexes were mostly higher. We say mostly because the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 87 points, which is actually a small decline on a percentage basis. The blue-chips were at 44,373, off 0.2%.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up a modest eight points to 6,277, but that was after hitting a 52-week high right after the open.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite had added 112 points or 0.5% to 20,753. It also hit a 52-week high soon after the open. Not to be a party pooper, the Nasdaq-100 Index was up 130 points to 22,986 after hitting a new high of 23.051.\n\nNvidia  (NVDA) , Broadcom AVGO and Coinbase  (COIN)  also hit new highs. Bitcoin was off $1,559 to $118,377, a day after hitting a new high of $123,166.\n\nStock market today: The banks weigh in\n\nThis morning's earnings reports are all about the banks.\n\nJP Morgan Chase  (JPM) , BlackRock  (BLK) , Citigroup  (C) , Wells Fargo  (WFC)  and Bank of New York Mellon  (BK)  all reported earnings that topped expectations. As for future statements, not all was rosy, with Wells Fargo guiding lower.\n\nCitigroup is the only one trading higher, gaining as much as 3%, while Wells Fargo is down close to 4%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is the other big news this morning. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that June CPI rose 0.3%, which was in line with expectations.\n\nYear over year, the CPI gained 2.7%. That's faster than May's 2.4% increase. Higher food and energy costs were behind the faster inflation, Bloomberg reported.\n\nCore CPI gained 0.2%, which was better than expected. The core figure was below forecasts for the fifth straight month, the news service reported.US BLS\n\nSo, how are stocks looking this morning?\n\nUp! S&P 500 futures have been rallying since yesterday's close (black line, below) and are up 0.4%.ThinkOrSwim\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq is even stronger, gaining 0.7% in premarket trading.ThinkOrSwim\n\nThe long end of the U.S. treasury curve is stronger (yields are down). Gold and crude are lower, while copper is slightly higher.\n\nStock Market Today: Dow slumps; S&P 500 and Nasdaq rally first appeared on TheStreet on Jul 15, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jul 15, 2025, where it first appeared.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "Let the earnings barrage commence.\n\nJPMorgan (JPM) is out with a big earnings beat, and CEO Jamie Dimon is voicing his support for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the very institution President Trump and his team are attacking.\n\n\"What I've seen the president say [is] he's not going to try to remove Jay Powell,\" Dimon told reporters on a call this morning. \"I think the independence of the Fed is absolutely critical, and not just for the current Fed chairman, who I respect, Jay Powell, but the next Fed chairman.\"\n\nWells Fargo (WFC) slashed its profit outlook after a weak second quarter, further cementing its status as a banking laggard.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) for June came in hotter than May's report as the first signs of Trump's tariffs appeared in the economic data. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, consumer prices rose 2.9% year over year compared to a 2.8% increase in May. Results were in line with economists' forecasts.\n\nHere is everything we touched on during Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid on Tuesday. Tune in live daily to Opening Bid at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nInteresting call out from JPMorgan Chase\n\nOn the aforementioned reporter call, I asked Dimon why he thinks \"elevated\" asset prices are a \"significant\" risk, as outlined in his prepared remarks.\n\n\"Look at it the other way around, Brian — what if they were not elevated?\" he said. \"I just see, you know, [asset prices] are fairly well priced in the top 10% or 15%, however you measure them. And then credit spreads are also, in my view, a little unnaturally low with all the potential exposures out there. And so the world is kind of pricing in a soft landing. And we've been in that soft landing very well.\"\n\nMarkets pro Lauren Goodwin said on Opening Bid that she agrees with Dimon on asset values.\n\n\"It's not necessarily that asset prices are unfair for the economic backdrop that we have today, but we know that there are risks on the horizon that are likely to impact the economic data and reality moving forward,\" she said.\n\nDerivative names from the Nvidia China news\n\nThe Nvidia H20 China development could be good news for its manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). Nvidia announced late Monday that it had received approval to start filing licenses to ship H20 chips, used for artificial intelligence development, to China.\n\nTSMC will report earnings on Thursday, hot on the heels of this win. By all indications, TSMC could lift its full-year revenue outlook due to strong AI chip demand.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe wild card here is how bullish TSMC execs will sound for 2026 given trade uncertainty and the AI capital expenditures cycle continuing to mature.\n\n\"We believe China sales impact has been in the $4-5 billion range and Nvidia has previously talked about China being a $50 billion market,\" Citi analyst Atif Malik wrote in a note. \"While US/China has patched up recently post EDA ban removal and a rare earth magnets deal, we believe this reversal could be part of the deal too. We believe investors should take a 'wait and see' approach before adding China contribution back to their models.\"\n\nHow popular is Apple's stock right now?\n\nBank of America's new fund manager survey, released today, noted that in the past three months, global investors have raised their allocation to the tech sector by the largest amount since March 2009. Fund managers increased their allocation from a net 1% Underweight tech in June to a net 14% Overweight, the highest since January 2025.\n\nYet over the past three months, Apple's (AAPL) stock has underperformed Google (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) by a country mile. Shares are up a measly 3% compared to double-digit percentage gains for those other names, led by a nearly 50% advance in Nvidia.\n\nPodcast: Why the CEO of this giant sovereign wealth fund is bullish on Microsoft\n\nClearly, Apple is being held back by concerns about its exposure to China during the Trump trade war and stalled AI efforts.\n\nNasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price•USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow View Quote Details\n\n210.53\n\n-\n\n+(0.92%)\n\nAs of 12:13:09 PM EDT.

          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) is unchanged, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview]) (DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) is down -0.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) is up +0.51%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) are up +0.02%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) are up +0.57%. \n\nStock indexes rallied early the session due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield is currently up +4.8 bp and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks. \n\nThe Dow was undercut by negative breadth with 24 of the 30 stocks showing declines, led by Merck (MRK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRK/overview]) and American Express (AXP [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AXP/overview]).\n\nToday’s CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was driven partly by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May’s +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May’s +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news today after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a “very good place” and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants “not to worry about August 12.”  Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is “all part of a mosaic” in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.  Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%. Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don’t relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nToday’s July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June’s level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) is down -3% today due to some long liquidation pressure following the recent rally on hopes for more favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled, “Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,” which may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May.  Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan’s US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports today include Blackrock, Citigroup, JP Morgan, NY Bank of Mellon, Wells Fargo, and State Street. Key earnings reports Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research. \n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.31%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) today are down -13.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield is up by +4.8 bp at 4.481%.  T-note prices being undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 55% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate today rose to a 4.75-month high and is currently up +1.5 bp at 2.419%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration’s campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued today, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed’s independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition.  Mr. Powell’s term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May-2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell’s term ends in May 2026, or earlier “for cause,” based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed’s building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp at 2.710%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +2.2 bp at

Corp. \n\nIn Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]) news today, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla’s top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks are doing well today after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to

          "content": "US-based rare earth materials miner MP Materials Corp. (MP) saw its stock soar more than 25% Tuesday after announcing a deal with Apple (AAPL).\n\nApple on Tuesday said that it had committed to a $500 million multiyear deal with MP Materials to buy its rare earth magnets for the tech giant's products.\n\nNYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price•USD\n\n(MP)\n\nFollow View Quote Details\n\n61.16\n\n-\n\n+(26.05%)\n\nAs of 12:06:09 PM EDT. Market Open.  MPAAPL\n\nAdvanced Chart\n\nThe iPhone maker said the deal was part of its effort to build out its US supply chain. Apple has committed to spending over $500 billion in the US to help expand its domestic manufacturing capacity. Rare earth magnets are used in everything from consumer electronics to electric vehicles and defense systems.\n\n“Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday. “We couldn’t be more excited about the future of American manufacturing, and we will continue to invest in the ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit of the American people.”\n\nApple has come under pressure over the past several months from President Trump, who has threatened the company with 25% tariffs on its overseas-made iPhones if the company doesn’t move production to the US.\n\nApple stock rose around 1% in midday trading. Shares of the company are down more than 16% in 2025, with the stock lagging its so-called Magnificent Seven Big Tech peers during a rough start to the year. The iPhone maker has dealt with the fallout from Trump’s trade war and a DOJ antitrust probe just as it has fallen behind on AI.\n\nMeanwhile, MP Materials, which went public in 2020, has gained 291% in 2025 and is up roughly 100% over the past month alone. Shares of the rare earths producer soared following an investment from the US Department of Defense last week. The company said on July 10 that the Defense Department would purchase $400 million of its preferred shares to become its largest shareholder, as the US looks to build out its domestic rare earth magnet supply chain.MP Materials logo.

          "content": "Investing.com -- Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to adopt Samsung (KS:005930) Display’s crease-free display solution for its foldable iPhone set to enter mass production in the second half of 2026, according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nThe tech giant will use Samsung’s solution rather than developing its own design to ensure stable mass production. This decision will benefit suppliers aligned with Samsung Display, with Fine M-Tec emerging as the primary beneficiary.\n\nFine M-Tec, which supplies display metal plates (also known as internal hinges), is projected to begin shipping components for the foldable iPhone in the first quarter of 2026. These metal plates, priced between $30-35 per unit, are a key element in creating crease-free displays by distributing and controlling bending stress during folding.\n\nThe company is expected to ship 13-15 million units in 2026, with an estimated 80% or higher supply share. The shipment volume exceeds final product assembly requirements due to yield losses and repair stock needs.\n\nTo meet Apple’s strict crease-free requirements, Fine M-Tec will implement laser drilling technology to create microstructures that better guide stress distribution. This advanced technique supports higher average selling prices compared to the etching process currently used in Samsung’s metal plates ($30-35 versus approximately $20).\n\nFine M-Tec is also benefiting from Samsung’s own foldable phone business. Samsung’s upcoming Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 models are projected to ship around 7 million units in 2025, representing roughly 40% year-over-year growth compared to 2024 models.\n\nThe company plans to expand its production capacity in Vietnam to meet demand for Apple’s foldable iPhone components, according to Kuo.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

MP Materials and Apple are partnering to produce rare-earth magnets. Rare-earth magnet production at the Texas facility is expected to start in 2027. 10 stocks we like better than MP Materials ›\n\nThe market opened mixed today with the S&P 500 inching higher and the Dow Jones Industrial Average nudging lower. One thing that seems a lot less mixed, however, is the market's enthusiasm for rare-earths producer MP Materials(NYSE: MP) stock. The company announced a partnership with Apple with respect to rare-earth magnets, driving the bulls to load up on shares.\n\nAs of 10:13 a.m. ET, shares of MP Materials are up 20.1%.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe attraction these companies have for each other is even stronger due to a rare-earth magnet deal\n\nExpanding a relationship that has lasted for nearly five years, MP Materials announced that it signed a long-term commitment with Apple -- a $500 million partnership -- to supply the tech company with magnets produced at a rare-earth magnet production facility that it's developing in Texas. MP Materials will source the magnets with recycled rare-earth feedstock from its production facility in California.

The feedstock will be sourced from post-industrial and end-of-life magnets, marking a major milestone in both companies’ long-standing efforts to create sustainable, domestic supply chains.\n\nMost Read on Design & Development Today:\n\nIsraeli Startup Says Its New Technology Will Save Planet The World's Skinniest EV Isn't Very Fast Northrop Grumman Completes Key Test for Exoplanetary Ascent Propulsion Racing Success Comes Down to a Matter of Microns\n\nFor nearly five years, Apple and MP Materials have been piloting advanced recycling technology that enables recycled rare earth magnets to be processed into material that meets Apple’s exacting standards for performance and design. Building on this technical collaboration, MP will construct a commercial-scale, dedicated recycling line at Mountain Pass enabling the processing of a range of inputs, including magnet scrap and components recovered from end-of-life products.\n\nIn addition, to fulfill this agreement with Apple—and in line with its public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Defense—MP Materials will significantly expand the capacity of its Fort Worth magnetics facility. Magnet shipments are expected to begin in 2027 and ramp up to support hundreds of millions of Apple devices. MP Materials and Apple will also innovate together to accelerate technological advancements in magnet production, as well as end-of-life recovery.\n\nJames Litinsky, Founder, Chairman and CEO of MP Materials, said, “We are proud to partner with Apple to launch MP’s recycling platform and scale up our magnetics business. This collaboration deepens our vertical integration, strengthens supply chain resilience, and reinforces America’s industrial capacity at a pivotal moment.”\n\nRare earth magnets are essential components in smartphones, computers, wearables, and other electronics, as well as vehicles, robotics, and energy systems. This agreement advances MP’s mission to restore the full rare earth supply chain to the United States while raising the global standard for sustainable production. By recovering rare earth elements from recycled materials, MP aims to reduce waste, conserve natural resources, and drive cost-competitive domestic magnet production.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our daily newsletter featuring breaking engineering industry news.\n\nView Comments",

We’re meeting them where they are – distributing Square’s industry leading tools to a new generation of smaller, next-gen sellers, natively within Cash App.\"\n\nTap to Pay on iPhone is the most requested feature from Cash App Business customers – and with good reason. In early beta testing, sellers using Tap to Pay on iPhone saw a 35% increase in inbound purchase volume from their customers compared to similar sellers who did not use the service, demonstrating the feature’s real potential to grow earnings for small merchants.2\n\nAs Tap to Pay on iPhone becomes a growing industry standard, Cash App is delivering this experience natively within its ecosystem. Sellers can now accept contactless payments including credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and other digital wallets from customers outside of Cash App, without downloading additional apps or buying card readers.\n\nUsing Tap to Pay on iPhone is easy, secure and private. With Tap to Pay on iPhone, at checkout, sellers will simply prompt the customer to hold their contactless payment near the seller’s iPhone, and the payment will be securely completed using NFC technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple’s Tap to Pay on iPhone technology uses the built-in security and privacy features of iPhone to help protect your business and customer data. Apple doesn’t store card numbers on Apple servers, so sellers and customers can rest assured that their data stays theirs.*\n\nTap to Pay on iPhone enables Cash App Business customers to use a contactless payment acceptance solution that is easy to set up and use. Sellers can unlock contactless payment acceptance within minutes through the Cash App iOS app on an iPhone XS or later, running the latest version of iOS.\n\nFor more information on Cash App Business, please click here.\n\n*Encrypted card numbers are temporarily stored on iPhone only for transactions made in Store and Forward mode.\n\nAbout Cash App\n\nCash App is the money app. Banking* on Cash App is easy: customers can receive paychecks early with direct deposit, spend money where Visa is accepted with a personalized Cash App Card, and grow their money with a separate savings balance - all without hidden fees. Customers can also create a unique $Cashtag to share with anyone to get paid fast, make purchases with Cash App Pay, trade stocks and buy and sell bitcoin, and pay over time with Cash App Afterpay. Download Cash App for free at cash.app/download.\n\n*Cash App is a financial services platform, not a bank. Banking services provided by Cash App’s bank partner(s). Prepaid debit cards issued by Sutton Bank, Member FDIC. See cash.app for more details.\n\n____________________ 1 Sellers include barbers & beauty professionals, food & drink vendors, home & repair providers, and local goods and services. 2 Internal analysis of Tap to Pay on iPhone driving 36% incremental lift on GPV earned by Cash App Business sellers.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250715052350/en/\n\nContacts\n\nPress Contact \r\npress@cash.app\n\nView Comments",

Nearly $3 billion will be invested in the project, with more than 1,200 individuals employed across the construction and ongoing operations of the campus. Entry into Vantage’s eighth North American market signals the company’s pursuit of strategic opportunities outside of Tier I locations as it joins major technology juggernauts Google, Apple and Microsoft in the growing region.\n\nSited on nearly 137 acres, the campus will include four multi-story data centers totaling more than one million square feet. The first two buildings are fully leased with the first building scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nDesigned to meet the unique needs of AI deployments, NV1 will support densities ranging from 360W to more than 720W per square foot. The campus will have the flexibility to support both traditional air-cooled compute loads as well as next generation GPU loads using liquid cooling. It will feature N+1 electrical redundancy and N+2 mechanical redundancy for enhanced reliability.\n\nNV1 will be built in alignment with Vantage’s \"sustainable by design\" blueprint and will achieve an industry-leading low water usage effectiveness (WUE) due to a closed-loop chiller system that minimizes the need for large volumes of water for cooling. The campus is expected to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification.\n\n\"As the global race for AI dominance continues, Vantage is leading the delivery of digital infrastructure to support the innovation and applications of the world’s largest technology enterprises,\" said Dana Adams, president, North America at Vantage Data Centers. \"The scale and pace at which our customers need business-critical capacity is at an all-time high. Nevada provided us a strategic opportunity to accelerate time-to-market for these customers while supporting the local economy through the creation of long-term jobs and tax revenue. The warm welcome we’ve received from the state is overwhelming, and we look forward to advancing the region’s growing digital hub together.\"\n\n\"We’re proud to welcome Vantage Data Centers to the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center and Storey County,\" said Austin Osborne, Storey County manager. \"Their arrival marks another important milestone in the growth of our region’s digital infrastructure, bringing both significant economic development and high-quality jobs to our community. This project further solidifies Storey County’s role as a key hub for forward-thinking industries, and we look forward to the long-term opportunities and partnerships it will create.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCommitted to being a good neighbor, Vantage has established a partnership with the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN) to support workforce development and community engagement initiatives in the area.\n\nFor more information about Vantage’s growing presence across North America, please visit: https://vantage-dc.com/data-center-locations/north-america/.\n\nAbout Vantage Data Centers\n\nVantage Data Centers is the global leader in digital infrastructure serving the world’s most influential AI and cloud enterprises.

          "content": "Jamf\n\nQ2 2025 Financial Results Expected to Exceed High End of Guidance Ranges\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jamf (NASDAQ: JAMF), the standard in managing and securing Apple at work, today announced a strategic reinvestment plan to help drive long-term growth, improve operational efficiency and enhance shareholder value.\n\nJamf’s recent comprehensive systems update, spanning both front- and back-office operations, has provided enhanced insights into Jamf’s business and growth opportunities. As a result, Jamf is embarking on a strategic reinvestment plan to support the continued success of the business. This plan includes strategic reallocation of resources to allow for investment in areas with the highest potential to fuel growth and drive additional operational leverage in the business. Two key focus areas are:\n\n1.Go-To-Market Enhancement\n\nJamf is taking steps to realign its go-to-market organization to allow for investment in areas that have the greatest opportunity for growth and align with our platform strategy via the Jamf for Mac, Jamf for Mobile, Jamf for K-12, and Jamf for SMB solutions.\n\nEnhance growth in Enterprise: increasing investment and resources to support Enterprise customers, which deliver higher growth, stronger retention, and greater return on investment. Simplify approach to SMB: scaling through the channel while also developing a more automated customer solution and experience to deliver greater customer value and improve operational efficiency.\n\n2. AI Investments\n\nIn addition to the efficiencies experienced over the last year from deploying AI within the sales, product and customer success groups, Jamf is further accelerating investments in AI capabilities that improve the customer experience in the Jamf product platform and drive further productivity enhancements by accelerating delivery of AI- and automation-driven solutions across the entire organization.\n\nIn order to facilitate the strategic reinvestment plan, the Company will reduce its workforce by approximately 6.4%. The Company will reduce roles across its go-to-market and other functions to align with the strategic reinvestment plan, as well as reducing spans and layers throughout the organization.\n\nJamf currently estimates that it will incur charges of approximately $11.0 to $12.5 million in connection with the workforce reduction, consisting of cash expenditures for notice period and severance payments, employee benefits, and related costs. The Company expects that most of the charges will be incurred in the third quarter of 2025 and that the execution of the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter of 2025. The Company intends to exclude the charges associated with the workforce reduction from certain of its non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ2 2025 Financial Results Expected to Exceed High End of Guidance Ranges\n\nJamf expects to exceed the high end of the guidance ranges previously issued with respect to the second quarter of 2025. On May 6, 2025, the company issued the following guidance ranges for the second quarter of 2025:\n\nTotal revenue of $167.5 to $169.5 million; and Non-GAAP operating income of $29.5 to $30.5 million.\n\nThe Company will provide more details regarding the strategic reinvestment plan and its financial impact on subsequent periods during its second quarter 2025 earnings call to be held on August 7, 2025.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes reference to non-GAAP Operating Income, a non-GAAP financial measure, which reflects operating income (loss) excluding certain non-operational or non-recurring items, including amortization expense, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expense, payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, system transformation costs, and other special or non-recurring items. Jamf believes that non-GAAP financial measures, may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with Jamf’s past financial performance, provide additional understanding of factors and trends affecting Jamf’s business, and assist in comparisons with other companies, some of which use similar non-GAAP information to supplement their GAAP result. Non-GAAP Operating Income is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for operating income (loss) presented in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude certain expenses that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Jamf’s financial statements. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by Jamf’s management about which expenses are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Further, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized. It may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains “forward looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws that involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, statements regarding statements regarding the Company’s expectations for its financial and operating performance in the second quarter of 2025, the benefits Jamf anticipates from the strategic reinvestment plan, the strategic reinvestment plan and its impact on Jamf’s business and financial results, including with respect to Jamf’s ability to achieve growth and profitability goals, and Jamf’s estimates of the amount and timing of charges that it expects to incur in connection with the strategic reinvestment plan.

          "content": "In the first-of-its-kind deal, Apple and MP Materials will launch an all-new recycling facility for processing recycled rare earth elements\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif., July 15, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Apple® announced a new commitment of $500 million with MP Materials, the only fully integrated rare earth producer in the United States. With this multiyear deal, Apple is committed to buying American-made rare earth magnets developed at MP Materials’ flagship Independence facility in Fort Worth, Texas. The two companies will also work together to establish a cutting-edge rare earth recycling line in Mountain Pass, California, and develop novel magnet materials and innovative processing technologies to enhance magnet performance. The commitment is part of Apple’s pledge to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, and builds on the company’s long history of investment in American innovation, advanced manufacturing, and next-generation recycling technologies.\n\n\"American innovation drives everything we do at Apple, and we’re proud to deepen our investment in the U.S. economy,\" said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. \"Rare earth materials are essential for making advanced technology, and this partnership will help strengthen the supply of these vital materials here in the United States. We couldn’t be more excited about the future of American manufacturing, and we will continue to invest in the ingenuity, creativity, and innovative spirit of the American people.\"\n\nApple and MP Materials will build out the state-of-the-art Texas factory with a series of neodymium magnet manufacturing lines specifically designed for Apple products. The new equipment and technical capacity will allow MP Materials to significantly boost its overall production. Once built, the American-made magnets will be shipped across the country and all over the world, helping to meet increasing global demand for the material. The increased production will support dozens of new jobs in advanced manufacturing and R&D. The two companies will provide extensive training to develop the workforce, building an entirely new pool of U.S. talent and expertise in magnet manufacturing.\n\nWhen complete, the new recycling facility in Mountain Pass, California will enable MP Materials to take in recycled rare earth feedstock — including material from used electronics and post-industrial scrap — and reprocess it for use in Apple products. For nearly five years, Apple and MP Materials have been piloting advanced recycling technology that enables recycled rare earth magnets to be processed into material that meets Apple’s exacting standards for performance and design. The companies will continue to innovate together to improve magnet production, as well as end-of-life recovery.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple pioneered the use of recycled rare earth elements in consumer electronics, first introducing them in the Taptic Engine® of iPhone® 11 in 2019. Today, nearly all magnets across Apple devices are made with 100 percent recycled rare earth elements. The collaboration with MP Materials will help secure domestic supply of this critical material, strengthen the U.S. rare earth industry’s capabilities to capture more raw material, and advance environmental progress with innovative recycling methods.\n\nApple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. Apple’s six software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, visionOS, and tvOS — provide seamless experiences across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud, and Apple TV+. Apple’s more than 150,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on earth and to leaving the world better than we found it.\n\nNOTE TO EDITORS: For additional information visit Apple Newsroom (www.apple.com/newsroom), or email Apple’s Media Helpline at media.help@apple.com.\n\n© 2025 Apple Inc.

          "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been facing criticism for what many see as underwhelming AI efforts, with some suggesting the tech giant buy an AI company. But Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist Cory Johnson explains that it may not make sense for Apple to make a big AI purchase. Find out why in the video above.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nOne of the things about acquiring an AI company right now, we certainly see it from the headlines from, in particular, Mark Zuckerberg taking over hiring at Meta, is that the assets walk out the door every day. You might have a great large language model all cooked up, but the ability to evolve upon that, um, is really those, those hard-to-come-by AI engineers, and those engineers getting offers which are kind of hard to believe, but a hundred million, two hundred million, um, you know, Juan Soto kind of numbers, uh, uh, you know, there's maybe true, those may be related to weird compensation involving stock options over time, but I think that the notion that you would go out and buy a company and own the assets isn't what really happens here. What happens is the assets are sitting in a chair and can take the elevator out and be gone the next day. So it's a trickier thing in this era as this industry evolves. And I think that that's the point, right? Is that Apple has never been first to the game. You could argue maybe back in the seventies when they invented some of the first personal computers, then they were first to the game. But Apple has typically not been first to the game in the products that they release. They wait for the pioneers to take the arrows, and then they create just a better product. And we've seen that time and again from Apple.\n\n02:37 Speaker B\n\nHow would you generally characterize, Corey, Apple's AI approach, Apple's AI strategy, and how you see it differing than a lot of the other tech giants we talk so much about?\n\n03:04 Corey\n\nWell, I think it's really important that it follows a lot of the things that they do from a product basis, whether it's software or hardware. They are very focused on user privacy, and they're very focused with the things happening on the device, which is how they make their money is selling devices. Yes, services are an increasing component of their revenue. But I think that going forward, we're going to see from Apple is they're going to start to incorporate pieces of AI into these devices. They're not willing to have the problems that OpenAI Chat GPT has given with the hallucinations, or, or Claude or Gemini. They want to have a higher quality product. I think they've been burned by some of the errors we've seen from Siri, and yet the Siri errors are nowhere near as bad as the results that have come out of Chat GPT or Gemini or even Claude over the course of the last couple of years. And I think that what they want to have are some in-app or on-device AI processing that's happening, and the chips are just getting there. And what that's going to mean is a real big turnover in phones that won't be able to do things that the most of the phones in the market, uh, uh, the new phones in the market will be able to do. And it's going to create some real sort of device envy among their users with the new iPhones coming out this fall, and indeed the phones coming out next year and the year after that. They're going to start to look really different. They're actually going to physically look very different. We're going to have a foldable iPhone as well. But the notion that you can do certain things in AI with a newer iPhone that you can't with an old iPhone could really create a new driver of demand for their physical devices.

It was Apple's eighth straight quarter of decline.\n\nHuawei reclaimed the top spot after more than four years, with a market share of 18.1%. The Shenzhen-based tech giant shipped 12.5 million phones in the second quarter, down 3.4% year-on-year.\n\nXiaomi, which ranks fourth, is the only smartphone maker to record growth in shipments in the last quarter. Vivo, which ranks second, saw shipments decline 10.1%, the steepest among the top five selling brands.\n\nChina's smartphone shipments overall dropped 4.0% year-on-year to 69 million units in the second quarter as growth momentum driven by the government subsidies subdued amid broader weakness.\n\n\"The broader economic environment presents ongoing challenges, with consumer confidence remaining subdued,\" said Arthur Guo, senior research analyst at IDC.\n\nA significant uplift in smartphone demand is unlikely in the immediate term, and the market will navigate a more complex landscape in the second half of the year, he added.\n\n(Reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Louise Heavens)",

          "content": "TAIPEI, July 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanessa Lee, Vice President of Materials Management at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), has drawn industry attention with her unexpected resignation. One month after taking an extended leave, TSMC announced on July 11 that Lee has stepped down for personal reasons and will officially depart on July 13, 2025.\n\nCliff Hou, Senior Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer, will concurrently assume responsibility for materials management.\n\nAccording to sources, TSMC(2330.TW) recruited Lee in 2022 due to her extensive procurement experience at leading U.S. tech firms, including Apple and Alphabet Inc. Her sudden departure has sparked a wave of speculation. While some attribute it to personal career planning, others suggest internal management frictions may have played a role—though none of these claims have been confirmed.\n\nLee joined TSMC in 2022 as Senior Director of Materials Management and was promoted to Vice President in 2024, becoming the youngest person to hold that title in the company's history.\n\nHer prior role as Apple's director of global procurement was widely viewed as instrumental to her recruitment. TSMC is said to have made significant efforts to bring her onboard, viewing her leadership in managing complex supplier ecosystems as critical.\n\nIn May 2025, Lee was seen attending a private dinner between NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang, TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei, and other executives, highlighting her growing influence within the organization. She also represented the company at several major supply chain events during her tenure.\n\nShe holds a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Soochow University and a master's degree in chemistry from National Taiwan University.\n\nBefore joining TSMC, Lee served as Global Commodity Manager at Alphabet Inc. (2020–2022), Procurement Director at Apple (2011–2019), Senior Sourcing Manager at Qualcomm Inc. (2007–2011), and Technical Marketing Manager at Hermes-Epitek (2004–2007)—the latter later acquired by ASML Holding.\n\nShe remains best known in the industry for her tenure at Apple, where she exercised global procurement authority and was instrumental in shaping the company's supplier relationships.\n\nAccording to TSMC's official website:\n\n\"Ms. Vanessa Lee is Vice President of the Materials Management Organization at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC). Ms. Vanessa Lee joined TSMC in 2022 and was appointed Senior Director of Materials Management. She established a working model and system to provide TSMC's demand forecast to suppliers, and built capability to monitor and track the development and delivery status of TSMC's key suppliers. This capability and the resulting transparency significantly raised the efficiency of collaboration between TSMC and its suppliers, and enabled TSMC to overcome supply chain disruptions in tools and materials during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStory Continues\n\nPrior to joining TSMC, Ms. Vanessa Lee worked for Google as global commodity manager between 2020 and 2022. She was a procurement director at Apple from 2011 to 2019, and a senior sourcing manager at Qualcomm from 2007 to 2011.\"Cision\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digitimes-asia-exit-of-tsmcs-star-procurement-vp-raises-industry-eyebrows-302505286.html\n\nSOURCE DIGITIMES ASIA\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "Key Points\n\nNvidia is driving the adoption of AI across the global economy. Broadcom's custom AI chip business is booming.10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›\n\nThe tech sector has historically been a hotbed for monster growth stocks, and that continues to be the case as artificial intelligence (AI) takes over the global economy. It's no surprise that some of the best-performing stocks in recent years have been leading chip companies.\n\nBut the investment in AI is just getting started. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) continue to see robust demand for their AI products. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) has doubled over the last five years, but these chip stocks have significantly outpaced it and could beat it again over the next five years.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »\n\nImage source: Nvidia.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares of Nvidia have rocketed almost 1,500% since July 2020. However, it's still growing revenue and earnings at rates that can justify more highs for the stock. After falling with the broader market earlier this year, the stock has surged to record highs.\n\nNvidia posted a 69% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter, driven by strong demand for its new Blackwell computing system for advanced AI workloads. \"Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation,\" CEO Jensen Huang said.\n\nHuang is a CEO worth betting your money on. For more than two decades, Nvidia's main business was making graphics cards for PCs and video game consoles. But Huang expanded the company's addressable market to high-performance computing markets like data centers, which today make up nearly 90% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\nNvidia is now one of the most profitable companies in the world. Over the last year, it earned $77 billion in net income on $148 billion of revenue, representing a sky-high margin of 51%. The company is reinvesting those profits in more innovation. Nvidia is already ramping up its Nvidia GB300 NVL72 platform, which features 72 Blackwell Ultra graphics processing units (GPUs) and 36 Arm-based Nvidia Grace chips. This new Blackwell Ultra computing system was built for next-level AI reasoning, providing a 50-times jump in AI factory output.\n\nThe number of chips on these systems tells you why Nvidia's margins are so high. It is packaging together a bunch of state-of-the-art chips into a single platform and selling it for a premium. Apple is reportedly set to spend $1 billion on 250 GB300 systems.\n\nCurrent Wall Street estimates have Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings growing at an annualized rate of 20% through 2030. The stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 38 on this year's estimate, but the P/E drops to 22 on 2030 estimates. Nvidia stock should continue to follow earnings, potentially doubling the stock within the next five years.\n\n2. Broadcom\n\nNvidia isn't the only way to play the growth in AI infrastructure. There's also tremendous demand for custom AI accelerators, software, networking, and security solutions, which is benefiting Broadcom. The stock rocketed 762% over the last five years. While it may not match that performance over the next five years, it could at least double.\n\nThe company's revenue grew 25% year over year last quarter. AI chip revenue alone grew 77% year over year, and management's outlook calls for more growth in custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, and networking products for data centers.\n\nBroadcom is in a great position to meet growing demand for faster data transfer speeds for advanced AI workloads. Its new Tomahawk 6 Ethernet switch offers 102.4 terabits per second of capacity to improve computing performance.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom expects three existing customers for its AI XPUs to deploy 1 million accelerated clusters by 2027. This demand should continue to benefit Broadcom's profitability. Management has a long record of investing in opportunities that generate growing free cash flow.\n\nLast year, Broadcom generated $19 billion in free cash flow on $51 billion of revenue. By fiscal 2029 ending in October, analysts expect free cash flow to reach $64 billion, representing a compound growth rate of 27%.\n\nThe stock is trading at 36 times this year's free-cash-flow estimate, which is justified considering the opportunity ahead. Given the insatiable demand for AI infrastructure, Nvidia and Broadcom are not likely going to experience a slowdown in demand for their cutting-edge technologies anytime soon. AI should power the chip industry to record revenues in the coming years. Based on analysts' estimates, investors can expect Broadcom stock to double by 2030.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip in China after securing Washington’s assurances that such shipments would get approved, a dramatic reversal from the Trump administration’s earlier stance on measures designed to limit Beijing’s AI ambitions.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhy Did Cars Get So Hard to See Out Of? Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year\n\nUS government officials told Nvidia they would green-light export licenses for the H20 artificial intelligence accelerator, the company said in a blog post on Monday — a move that may add billions to Nvidia’s revenue this year, restoring its ability to fulfill orders it had written off as lost due to government restrictions. Nvidia designed the less-advanced H20 chip to comply with earlier China trade curbs from Washington, which Trump’s team tightened in April to block H20 sales to the Asian country without a US permit.\n\nChief Executive Officer Jensen Huang — who met with President Donald Trump last week and is currently in Beijing attending a government-sponsored conference — appeared on Chinese state broadcaster CCTV shortly after Nvidia announced the decision, saying the company had secured approval to begin shipping. The Commerce Department, which oversees US export controls on chips and the tools used to make them, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the agency has already issued any H20 licenses.\n\nThe US move comes after weeks of thawing relations between Washington and Beijing, guided by an opaque trade truce that’s designed to see both sides approve exports of crucial technologies. After meeting his Chinese counterpart last week, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there’s a “strong desire on both sides” for a meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping later this year.\n\nWashington in recent weeks has lifted a spate of export controls — including on chip design software — imposed ahead of last month’s trade talks in London. That’s in return for China allowing more sales of rare-earth minerals needed to make a range of high-tech products, something US negotiators thought they’d achieved the month prior during talks in Geneva. Throughout and after those negotiations, Trump’s team insisted that controls on Nvidia’s H20 chips were not up for discussion.\n\nThe about-face marks a massive win for Huang, who has branded US chip curbs a “failure” that fueled the rise of Huawei Technologies Co. as Nvidia’s top Chinese rival. H20 shipments also would be a boon to companies from DeepSeek to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that — despite Huawei’s semiconductor progress — seek Nvidia hardware to train, expand and operate the AI services they’re building to compete with the likes of OpenAI.\n\nStory Continues\n\nNasdaq futures surged after Nvidia’s announcement, with Chinese stocks also reacting positively. Alibaba’s shares rose as much as 6% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, the Hang Seng Tech Index rose as much as 2.2% and data center operators like Beijing Sinnet Technology Co. jumped as much as 8.4%.\n\n“Nvidia resuming the sale of H20 to China is obviously positive,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “Not just for the company but also the AI semiconductor supply chain, as well as China tech platforms that are building AI capabilities. This is also a good development for US-China relations.”\n\nThe US first restricted Nvidia’s China sales in 2022, with sweeping curbs designed to prevent the Asian country from accessing advanced AI that could benefit the Chinese military. Nvidia has designed new processors for the China market several times to comply with those measures, which have become a central point of tension between Washington and Beijing.\n\nWithin months of the initial curbs, the chipmaker debuted the H800, which President Joe Biden’s administration effectively banned from sale to China in 2023. Nvidia responded with the H20, for which Biden officials weighed — but did not ultimately pursue — export restrictions. After Trump moved forward with H20 controls in April, Nvidia designed another China-focused product, the RTX PRO. The company described that chip as “fully compliant,” meaning that it falls below the technical thresholds that would necessitate Washington’s approval for export to the world’s second-largest economy.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nThe possibility that US officials will green-light Nvidia’s H20 exports to China reopens a key sales channel for the US chipmaker. The reversal could help recover a substantial portion of the $15 billion in fiscal 2026 data center revenue previously at risk, including $4-5 billion originally expected in 2H, and part of the $8 billion in unshipped 2Q orders.\n\n— Kunjan Sobhani and Oscar Hernandez Tejada, BI analysts\n\nClick here for the full analysis\n\nThe back and forth reflects the importance of the China market for Nvidia, which made history last week as the first company to hit $4 trillion of market value — a testament to its central role in providing the hardware for a post-ChatGPT AI infrastructure building boom. Huang is currently seeking discussions with Chinese leaders, including the commerce minister, with Nvidia’s central role in the global AI rollout likely on the agenda.\n\nHuang has also become increasingly vocal in Washington. He said recently that policymakers don’t need to worry about the Chinese military using Nvidia chips — one of the central justifications for US restrictions — since Beijing can’t rely on something that Washington could restrict at any point. He’s also warned that Nvidia’s loss of market share in the Asian country — from 95% to 50%, Huang said in May — directly benefits Huawei, the Shenzhen-based hardware giant at the center of Beijing’s tech ambitions.\n\nFor months, though, it seemed the tech chief was fighting a losing battle. While some Trump officials are keen to boost Nvidia’s sales in markets like the Middle East, they held the line on China curbs.\n\n“We obviously have huge respect for Jensen,” Sriram Krishnan, senior AI policy adviser at the White House, said in May. But “there is still bipartisan and broad concern about what can happen to these GPUs once they’re physically inside” China, Krishnan said.\n\nThe next month, during US-China trade negotiations in London, White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that Washington’s willingness to lift some chip-related export controls didn’t extend to the H20 measures. “The very, very high-end Nvidia stuff is not what I’m talking about,” he told CNBC at the time. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent repeated that message to senators later that week, saying that “there is no quid pro quo in terms of chips for rare earths.”\n\nYet when lawmakers pressed Bessent on exactly which semiconductor curbs could be up for discussion, he stopped short of ruling out a possible easing on leading-edge chips and production equipment.\n\n“What I’m saying is there’s no intent” to increase China’s access to advanced American semiconductors, Bessent said during congressional testimony in June. “In fact we have done just the opposite. We put export controls on the Nvidia H20, which I would regard as a very upper end chip, but not the highest end chip.”\n\n--With assistance from Winnie Hsu, Debby Wu, Cindy Wang and Meg Shen.\n\n(Updates with context throughout)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThailand’s Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough Spot The New Third Rail in Silicon Valley: Investing in Chinese AI ‘Our Goal Is to Get Their Money’: Inside a Firm Charged With Scamming Writers for Millions ‘The Turbulence Is Brutal’: Four Shark Tank Businesses on Tariffs Will Trade War Make South India the Next Manufacturing Hub?\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Despite the company’s biggest crisis in years, CEO Tim Cook remains firmly at the helm.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman, in his latest weekly \"Power On” report revealed that, Jeff Williams, Tim Cook‘s longtime deputy, has announced his retirement plans, leaving no clear successor in place.\n\nDespite this, there are no signs that Cook is planning to step down or is grooming a replacement. The board, which is largely made up of Cook loyalists, has not felt the need for a change in leadership.\n\nTrending: GoSun's Breakthrough Rooftop EV Charger Already Has 2,000+ Units Reserved — Become an Investor in This $41.3M Clean Energy Brand Today\n\nAlthough Apple’s shares have fallen 16% this year, they have seen a surge of around 1,500% since Cook assumed the role of CEO in 2011. Despite current challenges, including AI missteps and an aging product lineup, the board continues to view Cook as the only person capable of guiding the company.\n\nThere is a growing recognition among Apple’s top decision-makers that changes are necessary. Services chief Eddy Cue has internally warned that Apple risks becoming the next BlackBerry or Nokia if it doesn’t adapt quickly.\n\nSeveral top executives are nearing retirement age, marking the biggest leadership turnover in decades. Operations executive Sabih Khan will replace Williams, and CFO Luca Maestri handed over his duties to Kevan Parekh earlier this year.\n\nSee Also: Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market.

The most plausible successor remains hardware chief Ternus, who is about 15 years younger than Cook and has been with Apple for over 20 years.\n\nThe management reshuffle at Apple comes at a critical time for the tech giant. With several top executives nearing retirement, the company is facing its biggest leadership turnover in decades. This could potentially impact Apple’s strategic direction and its ability to innovate and compete in the rapidly evolving tech industry.\n\nDespite the challenges, the board’s continued faith in Cook’s leadership suggests that they believe he is the best person to navigate the company through this period of change.\n\nHowever, the lack of a clear successor to Cook raises questions about the company’s succession planning and its preparedness for any unforeseen circumstances that may require a change in leadership.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead Next:\n\nNamed a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share These five entrepreneurs are worth $223 billion – they all believe in one platform that offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

The pharmaceutical duties could rise as high as 200% after the initial phase-in, posing risks to companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE]), Merck (NYSE:MRK [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK]), and Eli Lilly (LLY [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY]), which rely on overseas production. Semiconductor tariffs are expected to affect both chipmakers and electronics manufacturers like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL]) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF]).\n\nTrump said he’s in talks with five to six countries and may strike “two or three” deals before his reciprocal tariffs take effect August 1, adding that a deal with India was among the most likely. “I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” he said.\n\nRelated chip stocks: AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA]), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD]), Broadcom (AVGO [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO]), Qualcomm (QCOM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM]), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM]), Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU]), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC]), Applied Materials (AMAT [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMAT]), KLA (KLAC [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAC]), ASML (ASML [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML]) and Lam Research (LRCX [https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LRCX]).\n\nMORE ON PFIZER, JOHNSON & JOHNSON, ETC.\n\n \t* TSMC's Q2 Earnings Preview - More Strength To Come [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801243-tsmc-stock-q2-earnings-preview-more-strength-to-come]\n \t* Taiwan Semiconductor: The 'Go To' Factory For AI Boom [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801144-taiwan-semiconductor-the-go-to-factory-for-ai-boom]\n \t* Intel Is Not For The Faint Of Heart [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800906-intel-is-not-for-the-faint-of-heart]\n \t* MP Materials rips to all-time high after $500M deal that ensures Apple supply apart from China [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467674-mp-materials-rips-to-all-time-high-after-500m-deal-that-ensures-apple-supply-apart-from-china]\n \t* Hearing, sleep apnea features for AirPods, Apple Watch available in Asia [https://seekingalpha.com/news/4467599-hearing-sleep-apnea-features-airpods-apple-watch-available-asia]\n\n ",

          "content": "A startup created by Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)) is stepping into the broadband spotlight as it goes after a share of the federal government's $42.5 billion Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. The company, Taara, says in a blog post that its wireless Lightbridge technology can beam high-speed internet over the air, offering an alternative to both fiber and satellite options.\n\nTaara has stated on X that it is “BEAD-ready,” referencing the initiative backed by the U.S. government. The post followed a major revision to the BEAD rules by the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration announced in early June, which now encourages technology neutrality rather than prioritizing traditional gigabit fiber. That change gives companies like Taara a chance to compete directly with Elon Musk's Starlink and T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) 5G Home Internet for funding.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf You're Age 35, 50, or 60: Here’s How Much You Should Have Saved Vs. Invested By Now $100k+ in investable assets? Match with a fiduciary advisor for free to learn how you can maximize your retirement and save on taxes – no cost, no obligation.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in the announcement that the revised BEAD guidelines reflect a shift toward technology neutrality, aiming to deliver high-speed internet more efficiently and cost-effectively without prioritizing any single approach.\n\nAlphabet's Taara Targets the Broadband Dead Zone Starlink Can't Reach\n\nTaara is led by Mahesh Krishnaswamy, a former Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google engineer who spun the project out of Alphabet's X moonshot factory after working on its earlier initiative, Loon. He has been focused on bridging global connectivity gaps since his early days in Chennai, India. \"Today, there are like 3 billion people still unconnected, and there is a dire need to bring them online,\" Krishnaswamy told Wired. His mission, he says, is to find scalable ways to bring high-speed internet to the places the fiber can't reach.\n\nRather than laying cable underground or relying on orbiting satellites, Taara says it uses devices installed on towers to send internet signals through the air across distances of up to 20 kilometers. The company positions this technology as a solution to the \"middle mile\" infrastructure gap, which connects the main internet backbone to local delivery systems like fiber or 5G towers.\n\nTrending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share\n\nAccording to Taara, this part of the network is especially crucial in remote and challenging environments, where last-mile connections often remain isolated without an efficient link to the larger grid. \"Without it, even the last-mile fiber connections or 5G cell towers remain stranded, unable to reach the broader internet,\" the company wrote in a LinkedIn post.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAlphabet’s GFiber says Taara’s Lightbridge can deliver speeds of up to 20 Gbps with ultra-low latency and no packet loss under clear weather conditions. This was demonstrated during a test in San Francisco with GFiber, which reported performance that matched high-end wired networks and exceeded traditional wireless radio systems.\n\nSee Also: This AI-Powered Trading Platform Has 5,000+ Users, 27 Pending Patents, and a $43.97M Valuation — You Can Become an Investor for Just $500.25\n\nDigicomm Deal Signals Taara's Play for Scaled, High-Speed Wireless Internet\n\nIn May, Taara partnered with Digicomm International, a major telecom equipment supplier, to help deploy its Lightbridge system at scale. Digicomm announced that it will deliver Taara’s Lightbridge to broadband providers, businesses, and municipalities seeking fast, high-capacity wireless internet.\n\nWired describes Taara as a high-speed, earthbound alternative to Starlink, one that's already shown success at events like Coachella and in cities where laying fiber is cost-prohibitive. Whether the federal government will see Lightbridge as a worthy investment remains to be seen, but Alphabet is clearly placing a bet on the future of middle-mile infrastructure.\n\nRead Next: Are you rich?

          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Tuesday closed down -0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.98%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up +0.13%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) fell -0.50%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) were unchanged.\n\nStock indexes rallied early Tuesday due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +5 bp, and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks.

stocks showing declines, led by American Express (AXP), Home Depot (HD), UnitedHealth (UNH), and Merck (MRK).\n\nTuesday's CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was partly driven by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs in the CPI report of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May's +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May's +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12.\" Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is \"all part of a mosaic\" in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nThere was also some positive trade news after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, US imports from Indonesia, totaling around $2.8 billion, will face a US tariff of 19%, which is likely to raise the price that US consumers pay for Indonesian goods.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent negative US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.  Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nTuesday's July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June's level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD) fell -3% Tuesday after the House failed to approve a procedural vote to begin consideration of three bills backed by the crypto industry.  Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which may promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets during the remainder of this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May. Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports on Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday closed mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.31%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) on Tuesday fell -14.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +5.2 bp to 4.485%.  T-note prices were undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 58% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate rose to a 4.75-month high and ended the day up +1.0 bp at 2.414%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued Tuesday, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed's independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Fed Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition. Mr. Powell's term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May 2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell's term ends in May 2026, or earlier, \"for cause,\" based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed's building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.712%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.5 bp to 4.625%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks generally closed higher on Tuesday, except for Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA), which closed more than -1% lower.  Apple (AAPL) closed slightly higher after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp.\n\nIn Tesla (TSLA) news, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla's top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks showed some strength Tuesday, and helped keep the Nasdaq 100 index in positive territory, after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than +4%.  Arm Holdings (ARM) rose more than +2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed lower on Tuesday as bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -3% on the failure of the House to approve a procedural vote to consider crypto-friendly bills.  Riot Platforms (RIOT) fell more than -3%, and Mara Holdings (MARA) fell by more than -2%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) fell -1.9%, and Coinbase (COIN) fell -1.5%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) fell by more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) fell -0.7% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners traded lower after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) fell -3%, and Southern Copper (SCCO) fell -2.4%.\n\nEarnings Reports

          "content": "STORY: U.S. stocks ended mixed on Tuesday, with the Dow dropping about one percent, the S&P 500 shedding four-tenths of a percent, but the Nasdaq ticked up nearly two-tenths of a percent.\n\nIt was the fourth session out of five that the technology-heavy Nasdaq posted a record close.\n\nAI-chip leader Nvidia was the primary factor. Its shares jumped 4% after the company unveiled plans to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China, explained Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance.\n\n\"As we know, Nvidia is the highest-valued stock in the market in the world, north of $4 trillion. So, when Nvidia moves sharply higher, which it is today, that in and of itself can move the Nasdaq. But Oracle, Apple, Microsoft, which are now over 500, those tech stocks are back in control for sure, and that is what's moving the market today.\"\n\nThe news buoyed other chipmakers, with Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer gaining nearly six-and-a-half and seven percent, respectively.

          "content": "Apple (AAPL) is in focus after announcing a $500 million deal to buy rare earth magnets from MP Materials (MP) as investors weigh CEO Tim Cook's role as the iPhone maker lags its Big Tech peers in the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nCreative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin sits down with Josh Lipton on Asking for a Trend to take a closer look at the latest from Apple.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trend here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nApple saying say it's going to invest $500 million into MP materials as a long-time apple watcher. You saw that and thought what?\n\n00:09 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I think it's it makes a lot of sense, right? Apple has taken every opportunity through the history of this company dating back to even you know the iPod where they've built, uh, bought storage and memory up in bulk again because memory prices of those things can fluctuate. So I think anytime that you can come in and buy in bulk something that gives you a fixed price that you know you can control that pricing for yourselves going forward, um, they're going to make that investment every time, right? In this term, right, whatever rare earths they need in order to manufacture, right, whether that's parts of product or batteries or whatever that is. Those are the things that they'll secure up if they can, and it makes a lot of sense because again, in supply chain management and being able to keep costs down, that's a very strategic move.\n\n00:52 Speaker A\n\nLet's stick with Cook. You saw how those analysts made some waves put out a note provocative at least and maybe it's time for a change in the C suite. What did you make of that?\n\n01:00 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I mean, I think the sentiment is really just coming from, you know, wanting to see more modern leaders or people who are coming up through the ranks that haven't been there or might bring a fresh take to the business. And I think again, right, the reality is if there was somebody better, like if Tim Cook or others thought that there was somebody better within Apple to run and move this company forward, I think they would make that change. Like I don't think this is a matter of pride or um, you know, or stubbornness. I think this is he's still the right guy. The investors believe he's the right guy. The board believes the right guy. And in fact, I believe a lot of the executives believe that he's the right guy. And so I think that's a key part of them keeping him in position. But now this again comes back to a new era of execution, which again, he is now seeing overseeing more of those businesses.\n\n01:44 Speaker A\n\nYeah, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, I saw reported he is Cook is staying put on this on the question of Apple and AI Ben. Investors, there are investors who are disappointed with where they're at. You can see that in in the stock and how it's reacted so far this year, we're down about nearly 20%. What do you make of that? How do you think about Apple's role in this AI market right now?\n\n02:07 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah, I mean, I think one of the best ways to just understand, I think where we're going here is is more not in every one technology or one winner's going to win everything here. You know, I think people like to bucket OpenAI or Google or others and say like these are the ones that are going to win, like this isn't a winner take all market, right? And that's in today's era of just querying right chat GPT or Gemini to do some search. We're moving to an era which is far more agentic, right, which means that you're going to have an agent, that agent is going to work on your behalf, and it's going to understand, you know, you Josh, your preferences, your likes, you're where you're at in the world, your location, like intimate levels of details of you and then go work with other agents, Google's agents, Amazon agents, Meta's agent, etc. So you'll have this one thing and all those agents will have domain expertise. And I think Apple's goal is to have domain expertise again on the customer on their ecosystem. And that's something that they can easily do, right? They don't need to boil the ocean. They can partner with OpenAI or Gemini if you just want to search the internet. But the key is having a smart, intelligent, and intimate agent that knows you that can go and work on your behalf for actions, do predictive things, do things on your behalf. And I think that's their broader strategy, and it's just doing what they can do well, which is create a much more agent or much more friendly customer experience when it comes to AI.\n\n03:27 Speaker A\n\nAnd can they get this done in house in Cupertino Ben? Or and I ask you because I've had analysts come on the show and tell me, it is time for Apple to bring out the checkbook. They're going to have to make a big deal, a big AI deal. I had one analyst tell me it should be perplexity. Um, that would you know, historically Apple Apple does deals, but they're they're smaller. I think the biggest one they ever had was biggest ever was beats for three billion. Um, what do you make of that line of questioning?\n\n04:02 Ben Bajarin\n\nYeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, I'd say there's two things, right? Apple always doesn't just look at technology, they look at culture. Is this a cultural fit? So that's also a question you've got to ask is who could they buy that fits into the broader culture of Apple. But I think, you know, again, I like Perplexity. I use Perplexity. They're a little bit of a different company. You still need a big foundational model even if you're using perplexity. So that doesn't entirely solve Apple's problems. I think there's actually some smaller acquisitions that can be made. You know, you pointed out Mark German actually said that Mistral is being looked at, which is a large foundational model. I think that would make a ton of sense. And there really are a lot of startups coming out of the valley doing really interesting things, and some of those teams and those individuals in their technology might be a better fit for Apple. But again, I think they don't necessarily need this big world internet foundational model. I think if they've got this agent that's got domain expertise, and that's about their ecosystem, their software, you the customer, and your preferences, and that agent can go work with other agents, which is how the world we're moving to an agentic AI. I think they have everything they need to do on that vision. The question is do they want to do more than that?

With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.\n\n\"Shrinking\"\n\n\"Shrinking\" follows a grieving therapist who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks.

Led by their brilliant but irascible leader, the notorious Jackson Lamb (Academy Award winner Sir Gary Oldman), they navigate the espionage world’s smoke and mirrors to defend England from sinister forces.\n\n\"Presumed Innocent\"\n\n\"Presumed Innocent\" is an eight-episode limited series starring and executive produced by Jake Gyllenhaal, hailing from David E. Kelley and executive producer J.J. Abrams and based on the New York Times bestselling novel of the same name by Scott Turow. Starring Gyllenhaal in the lead role of chief deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich, the series takes viewers on a gripping journey through the horrific murder that upends the Chicago Prosecuting Attorney’s office when one of its own is suspected of the crime. The series explores obsession, sex, politics, and the power and limits of love, as the accused fights to hold his family and marriage together. The star-studded ensemble cast of the thriller also includes Ruth Negga, Bill Camp, Elizabeth Marvel, Peter Sarsgaard, O-T Fagbenle and Renate Reinsve.\n\n\"Disclaimer\"\n\n\"Disclaimer\" is a gripping psychological thriller in seven chapters, starring Academy Award winners Cate Blanchett and Kevin Kline. Written and directed by five-time Academy Award winner Alfonso Cuarón, \"Disclaimer\" is based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Renée Knight. Acclaimed journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) built her reputation revealing the misdeeds and transgressions of others.

Two years after the \"accidental death\" of Grace’s abusive husband, the close-knit Garvey sisters may have moved on, but when past truths resurface, the ladies are thrust back into the spotlight, suspicions are at an all-time high, lies are told, secrets revealed and the sisters are forced to work out who they can trust.\n\n\"Dope Thief\"\n\nBased on Dennis Tafoya’s book \"Dope Thief,\" the series follows long-time Philly friends and delinquents who pose as DEA agents to rob an unknown house in the countryside, only to have their small-time grift become a life-and-death enterprise, as they unwittingly reveal and unravel the biggest hidden narcotics corridor on the Eastern Seaboard.\n\n\"The Gorge\"\n\nTwo highly-trained operatives (Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts in guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within. They bond from a distance while trying to stay vigilant in defending against an unseen enemy. When the cataclysmic threat to humanity is revealed to them, they must work together in a test of both their physical and mental strength to keep the secret in the gorge before it’s too late.\n\n\"Pachinko\"\n\nEpic in scope and intimate in tone, the story begins with a forbidden love and crescendos into a sweeping saga that journeys between Korea, Japan and America to tell an unforgettable story of war and peace, love and loss, triumph and reckoning.\n\n\"Your Friends & Neighbors\"\n\nAfter being fired in disgrace, a hedge fund manager still grappling with his recent divorce, resorts to stealing from his neighbors’ homes in the exceedingly affluent Westmont Village, only to discover that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined.\n\n\"Deaf President Now!\"\n\nThe story of the greatest civil rights movement most people have never heard of. \"Deaf President Now!\" recounts the eight days of historic protests held at Gallaudet University in 1988 after the school’s board of trustees appointed a hearing president over several very qualified Deaf candidates. After a week of rallies, boycotts and protests, the students of Gallaudet University triumph as the hearing president resigns and beloved dean Dr. I. King Jordan becomes the university’s first Deaf president. The protests marked a pivotal moment in civil rights history, with an impact that extended well beyond the Gallaudet campus, and paved the way for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \"Deaf President Now!\" features exclusive interviews with the five key figures of the movement, including the DPN4 — Jerry Covell, Bridgetta Bourne-Firl, Tim Rarus and Greg Hlibok — alongside I. King Jordan, as well as archival and scripted elements. The film also incorporates an experimental narrative approach called Deaf Point of View, using impressionistic visual photography and intricate sound design to thrust the audience into the Deaf experience.\n\n\"Bono: Stories of Surrender\"\n\n\"Bono: Stories of Surrender\" is a vivid reimagining of Bono’s critically acclaimed one-man stage show, \"Stories of Surrender: An Evening of Words, Music and Some Mischief…\" As he pulls back the curtain on a remarkable life and the family, friends and faith that have challenged and sustained him, he also reveals personal stories about his journey as a son, father, husband, activist and rock star. Along with never-before-seen, exclusive footage from the tour, the film features Bono performing many of the iconic U2 songs that have shaped his life and legacy.\n\n\"Dark Matter\"\n\nHailed as one of the best sci-fi novels of the decade, \"Dark Matter\" is a story about the road not taken. The series will follow Jason Dessen (played by Joel Edgerton), a physicist, professor and family man who — one night while walking home on the streets of Chicago — is abducted into an alternate version of his life. Wonder quickly turns to nightmare when he tries to return to his reality amid the mind-bending landscape of lives he could have lived. In this labyrinth of realities, he embarks on a harrowing journey to get back to his true family and save them from the most terrifying, unbeatable foe imaginable: himself.\n\nAll programs are currently streaming on Apple TV+.\n\nApple TV+ offers premium, compelling drama and comedy series, feature films, groundbreaking documentaries, and kids and family entertainment, and is available to watch across all your favorite screens.

          "content": "By David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the nation’s auto safety regulator will argue on Wednesday that the agency must actively oversee self-driving vehicle technology, a potential sign of a tougher approach than some critics expected.\n\nJonathan Morrison, chief counsel of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the first Trump administration, will testify to the U.S. Senate that autonomous vehicles offer potential benefits but also unique risks.\n\n\"NHTSA cannot sit back and wait for problems to arise with such developing technologies, but must demonstrate strong leadership,\" Morrison said in written testimony seen by Reuters.\n\nThe comments suggested NHTSA will continue to closely scrutinize self-driving vehicles. Some critics of the technology had expressed alarm over NHTSA staff cuts this year under a cost-cutting campaign led by Elon Musk, who was a close adviser to Trump and is CEO of self-driving automaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nThe Musk-Trump alliance prompted some critics to speculate that NHTSA would go easy on self-driving vehicle developers. But the relationship began to unravel in late May over Trump’s spending plans, and the two are now locked in a feud.\n\nNHTSA said last month it was seeking information from Tesla about social media videos of robotaxis and self-driving cars Tesla was testing in Austin, Texas. The videos were alleged to show one of the vehicles using the wrong lane and another speeding.\n\nSince October, NHTSA has been investigating 2.4 million Tesla vehicles with full self-driving technology after four reported collisions, including a 2023 fatal crash.\n\n\"The technical and policy challenges surrounding\n\nthese new technologies must be addressed,\" Morrison’s testimony said. \"Failure to do so will result in products that the public\n\nwill not accept and the agency will not tolerate.\"\n\nOther companies in the self-driving sector also were subjects of NHTSA investigations including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Waymo, which last year faced reports its robotaxis may have broken traffic laws. Waymo in May recalled 1,200 self-driving vehicles, and the probe remains open.\n\nRegulatory scrutiny increased after 2023 when a pedestrian was seriously injured by a GM Cruise self-driving car.\n\nThe first recorded death of a pedestrian related to self-driving technology was in 2018 in Tempe, Arizona.",

          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$SPX/overview]) (SPY [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/SPY/overview]) on Tuesday closed down -0.40%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$DOWI/overview]) (DIA [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/DIA/overview]) closed down -0.98%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/$IUXX/overview]) (QQQ [https://www.barchart.com/etfs-funds/quotes/QQQ/overview]) closed up +0.13%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ES*0/overview]) fell -0.50%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/NQ*0/overview]) were unchanged. \n\nStock indexes rallied early Tuesday due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield rose +5 bp, and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks. \n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was undercut by negative breadth with 26 of the 30 stocks showing declines, led by American Express (AXP [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AXP/overview]), Home Depot (HD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/HD/overview]), UnitedHealth (UNH [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/UNH/overview]), and Merck (MRK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MRK/overview]).\n\nTuesday's CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was partly driven by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs in the CPI report of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May's +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May's +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news Tuesday after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a \"very good place\" and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants \"not to worry about August 12.\" Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is \"all part of a mosaic\" in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nThere was also some positive trade news after President Trump announced that his administration had reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, US imports from Indonesia, totaling around $2.8 billion, will face a US tariff of 19%, which is likely to raise the price that US consumers pay for Indonesian goods. \n\nStocks have been undercut by recent negative US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1. Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%.  Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don't relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nTuesday's July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June's level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) fell -3% Tuesday after the House failed to approve a procedural vote to begin consideration of three bills backed by the crypto industry.  Bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past several weeks, driven by hopes for favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled \"Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,\" which may promote crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets during the remainder of this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May. Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan's US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports on Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports on Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports on Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research. \n\nOverseas stock markets on Tuesday closed mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 fell -0.31%.  China's Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nINTEREST RATES\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU2 [https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/ZN*0/overview]5) on Tuesday fell -14.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +5.2 bp to 4.485%.  T-note prices were undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 58% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate rose to a 4.75-month high and ended the day up +1.0 bp at 2.414%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration's campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued Tuesday, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed's independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Fed Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition. Mr. Powell's term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May 2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell's term ends in May 2026, or earlier, \"for cause,\" based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed's building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields were mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield fell -1.7 bp to 2.712%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield rose +2.5 bp to 4.625%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS STOCK MOVERS\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks generally closed higher on Tuesday, except for Meta Platforms (META [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/META/overview]) and Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]), which closed more than -1% lower.  Apple (AAPL [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AAPL/overview]) closed slightly higher after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp. \n\nIn Tesla (TSLA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TSLA/overview]) news, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla's top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks showed some strength Tuesday, and helped keep the Nasdaq 100 index in positive territory, after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/AMD/overview]) rose more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/NVDA/overview]) rose more than +4%.  Arm Holdings (ARM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/ARM/overview]) rose more than +2%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks closed lower on Tuesday as bitcoin (^BTCUSD [https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EBTCUSD/overview]) fell -3% on the failure of the House to approve a procedural vote to consider crypto-friendly bills.  Riot Platforms (RIOT [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/RIOT/overview]) fell more than -3%, and Mara Holdings (MARA [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MARA/overview]) fell by more than -2%.  MicroStrategy (MSTR [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/MSTR/overview]) fell -1.9%, and Coinbase (COIN [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/COIN/overview]) fell -1.5%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/BLK/overview]) fell by more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations. \n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/JPM/overview]) fell -0.7% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners traded lower after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products. Freeport McMoRan (FCX [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/FCX/overview]) fell -3%, and Southern Copper (SCCO [https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/SCCO/overview]) fell -2.4%. \n\nEARNINGS REPORTS (7/16/2025)\n\nPrologis Inc (PLD), Progressive Corp/The (PGR), M&T Bank Corp (MTB), PNC Financial

          "content": "We came across a bullish thesis on ASML Holding on FluentInQuality's Substack. As of 14ᵗʰ July, ASML Holding's share was trading at $806.73. ASML's trailing and forward P/E were 31.15 and 30.21 respectively according to Yahoo Finance.Jim Cramer Notes ASML Holding (ASML)'s \"Last Couple Quarters Have Been Weak\"\n\nA technician in a clean room working on a semiconductor device, illuminated by the machines.\n\nASML is not a chipmaker; it builds the machines that make the most advanced chips possible, forming the invisible foundation of modern computing. It monopolizes extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the cutting-edge process essential for fabricating next-gen semiconductors. No company can match ASML’s precision, which operates at a nanoscopic scale using 13.5nm light, space-grade ZEISS mirrors, and billionth-of-a-meter alignment. With zero real competitors, ASML stands as a gatekeeper to the global chip supply chain, enabling products from NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, Intel, and TSMC. Without ASML, advanced chips—and by extension AI, data centers, and national defense infrastructure—cannot be built.\n\nIts EUV tools sell for over $200 million each, but due to limited supply and overwhelming demand, ASML allocates rather than sells, maintaining a multi-year backlog. The firm’s moat is fortified by thousands of patents, irreplaceable suppliers, and two decades of lead time, making it effectively impossible to replicate even with unlimited capital. While capital intensive, ASML is extremely capital efficient, boasting near-50% gross margins, industry-leading returns, and consistent free cash flow that funds buybacks and dividends.\n\nEach new lithography node increases ASPs and deepens customer lock-in. As chips become more complex, demand for ASML’s precision rises—cementing it as a growing bottleneck in an increasingly consolidated industry. Its next leap, High NA EUV, is already underway. As the only Western firm producing such advanced lithography, ASML is also a geopolitical asset—banned in China, protected by allies. It doesn’t chase trends like AI or edge computing; it enables them. ASML is a fortress built on physics.\n\nPreviously we covered a bullish thesis on ASML Holding N.V. by Monopolistic Investor in May 2025, which highlighted the company’s leadership in EUV lithography, disciplined pricing strategy, and strong government backing. The company’s stock price has appreciated approximately by 8.06% since our coverage. This is because the thesis played out. Monopolistic Investor shares an identical view but emphasizes ASML’s geopolitical and technological indispensability.\n\nASML Holding is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 80 hedge fund portfolios held ASML at the end of first quarter which was 86 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ASML as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

          "content": "Apple received an unwanted spotlight last week when President Trump’s trade advisor, Peter Navarro, attacked CEO Tim Cook for not moving manufacturing out of China fast enough. In fact, having received similar pressure during Trump’s first term, Apple, in terms of what it sells in the U.S., now makes most iPhones in India and most laptops, AirPods, and other devices in Vietnam. Furthermore, Cook has committed over $500 billion to new U.S. manufacturing facilities and design centers that will employ about 20,000 Americans.\n\nNevertheless, by late last week attention had quickly shifted to Cook’s tenure as CEO.\n\nPart of this may be seasonal. There is often debate during the hot midsummer months—after annual shareholder meetings—over whether CEO is turnover increasing or decreasing. CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla has said that one factor behind this is an effort to create headlines during the “tape slump” of major business news. He suggested this behavior was behind a recent report by respected analysts Walter Piecyk and Joe Galone at Lightshed calling for Apple to consider replacing Cook amidst Apple’s struggles with artificial intelligence.\n\nWe believe that such short-sighted attacks on an icon of American industry could not be more misguided. Cook’s leadership is still critically needed at Apple.\n\nApple and AI\n\nWhile Apple hasn’t been a first mover in AI, it doesn’t need to be. In fact, it might benefit the company to not get sucked into the AI arms race amidst counterproductive and desperate moves from competitors—consider Meta offering cash bonuses of up to $100 million to poach AI engineers from rivals.\n\nAt our Yale CEO Summit last month, nearly 50% of CEOs polled believe that AI hype has already led to significant overinvestment within their companies. An equal proportion think that AI investments have been allocated inefficiently and profess disappointment with the return on investment.\n\nWhile nobody doubts the importance of AI to Apple’s future, a critical management skill is finding the right balance on the make vs. buy tradeoff. Developing products in-house is not the only way to go. Despite Apple’s setbacks with Apple Intelligence, a potential partnership or outright acquisition of Perplexity could transform Apple into an AI leader practically overnight, as noted by many savvy analysts, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives.\n\nThere are many examples of companies successfully buying or partnering their way into new products or business lines: IBM’s visionary acquisition of RedHat in 2019 gave it a foothold in cloud computing—now a core business. Pfizer’s partnership with BioNTech during the pandemic allowed for the rapid production of the COVID vaccine. Merck’s acquisition of Schering-Plough brought in the blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda, which now powers about half of its sales.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTransforming Apple\n\nDespite Apple’s AI stumbles, Cook deserves a long leash as one of the most revered chief executives of our time, with an unparalleled track record of accomplishment. A genuine tech visionary, he faced the daunting and unenviable task of succeeding the larger-than-life Steve Jobs. He assumed the reins with a rare blend of energy and humility, inspiring others to innovate without any personal grandiosity, transforming Apple into the world’s most valuable company.\n\nUnder Cook’s stewardship, Apple’s market value has soared from $350 billion in 2011 to more than $3 trillion today. Apple became the first U.S. company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2018, doubling that figure in 2020 and tripling it just three years later.\n\nDespite the echo-chamber accusations that Cook is nothing more than a supply chain guru and not a true product visionary, the truth is that Cook’s tenure has seen Apple revolutionize its product lineup, driving profound advancements for the iPhone, Mac, and iPad and introducing industry-leading devices such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, and Apple Vision Pro. His leadership has also expanded the Apple ecosystem, launching services like Apple Pay, which is growing every year, as well as Apple Music and Apple TV+.\n\nDespite this unparalleled record of achievement, even supporters of Cook wonder if he may have lost his touch or his creativity. Though strongly supporting Cook, CNBC anchor David Faber wondered aloud, “sometimes, as people get older, they may not be taking in as much information, or their expertise may be in an area that is no longer as specific to needs of their business, and I’m curious as to whether there is somebody else out there who might be in a better position to do that.”\n\nLong leadership\n\nThe first author of this essay has closely studied age and work—once called industrial gerontology—since the founding of the field decades ago, and my bookThe Hero’s Farewell: What Happens when CEOs Retire provided the first empirical studies of leaders in late career. There is no correspondence between age and invention, or age and leadership.\n\nOver 45 years of research on age and work, I have closely documented the effects of age and found potentially surprising results. Older workers tend to have greater sales skills and interpersonal savvy, with only modest declines in physical dexterity. Research on age and risk in engineering found that older managers were only mildly less willing to take risks. They took longer to make decisions, but they were better able to appreciate the value of new information.\n\nConsider some of the startling examples through history. Benjamin Franklin helped draft the Declaration of Independence at 70, invented bifocal glasses in his late 70s, and negotiated an agreement to salvage the Constitutional Convention at 81. France relied upon Charles De Gaulle to unify the nation while he was in his late sixties and seventies. Averell Harriman, after leading Union Pacific and Brown Brothers Harriman, served as one of America’s greatest diplomats, unofficially advising presidents until his nineties.\n\nCompared to these examples, at age 64, Cook is just getting started.\n\nOf course, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some steps Cook can take to strengthen Apple’s positioning, even beyond doubling down on AI development. As CNBC’s Jim Cramer pointed out, it would not hurt with the Trump administration if Apple accelerated some of its $500 billion commitment for domestic manufacturing. Moving some spending forward and accelerating that planned four-year timeline would be a tangible political and patriotic signal to rectify Trump’s fears that he is being played via delays and long timeframes. Similarly, it may not hurt Apple to add a respected technologist with AI, software, or hardware expertise to its board.\n\nBut clearly, Apple has stayed ripe for growth and product innovation under Cook, and the attacks on him and the company are half-baked.\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nRead more:\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has created more shareholder value than Steve Jobs. But suddenly his weaknesses are on display in the AI era Don’t count out Apple in the ‘AI race’: It might be in the best position of all Apple’s AI efforts ‘have struck midnight,’ and the only way it can stop getting further behind is acquiring Perplexity, analyst Dan Ives says Apple is facing a ‘fork in the road year’ on AI, but has one clear advantage, analysts say\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just made a $500 million move that could reshape the rare-earth supply chainand investors are taking notice of MP Materials (NYSE:MP). Under a new multiyear deal, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will source U.S.-made rare-earth magnets from MP starting in 2027, as part of its broader strategy to reduce reliance on China. These magnets are key components inside iPhones and other devicespowering things like the haptic engine and internal microphones. MP will produce the magnets in Texas, using recycled materials processed at a new California facility, both part of a vertically integrated supply chain that Apple hopes can withstand future geopolitical shocks.\n\nFor context, China has long dominated global rare-earth magnet production. But that dominance has come under pressure, especially after Beijing imposed export controls last spring in response to U.S. tariffs. That move caused a scramble among Western manufacturers and led to supply chain reevaluations across the tech industry. Apple, already under political pressure from former President Trump to bring more of its operations back to the U.S., appears to be responding with more tangible stepsstarting with this agreement. According to MP's SEC filing, Apple will make a $200 million prepayment, a rare move that signals commitment from both sides.\n\nThis shift also aligns with Apple's previously announced plan to spend $500 billion in the U.S. over four years. While analysts at Bank of America suggest much of that was already planned, the MP deal suggests Apple could be reallocating spending from other regions into strategic domestic capacity. Though the company continues expanding in India and Vietnam, this magnet supply agreement may signal that Apple sees long-term risk in depending on China for mission-critical inputs. And for MP, this could be a breakout momentcementing its role as a key supplier for one of the world's most valuable companies.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "Leading emergency information app Watch Duty uses Mapbox to provide critical up-to-date wildfire and emergency information to millions of users across 22 states.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, July 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mapbox announces an expansion of its partnership with Watch Duty, the nonprofit wildfire alert system used by millions of people across the U.S. to stay safe during wildfire emergencies. Built on the Mapbox location platform, Watch Duty has been recognized as one of TIME's Most Influential Companies of 2025, one of Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies of 2025, and the winner of the 2025 Apple Design Award for Social Impact.Mapbox Logo (PRNewsfoto/Mapbox)\n\n\"We love Watch Duty's mission and are happy to see so many others also recognizing its great contribution to the safety of those impacted by wildfires. Its success also affirms how organizations of any size — from volunteer-led nonprofits to global enterprises — can build mission-critical, scalable applications using Mapbox,\" said Cherie Wong, SVP of Location Services at Mapbox.\n\nDelivering Clarity When It Matters Most Watch Duty provides live wildfire incident updates through a dynamic, map-based app built with Mapbox GL JS, Mapbox map tiles, and custom map styling. Watch Duty makes thousands of updates per day during wildfire season, and Mapbox ensures that this highly dynamic content is delivered with exceptional geospatial context and precision. When every second counts and precise location awareness matters, Mapbox equips Watch Duty to reach users with actionable information using maps optimized for speed, clarity, and accessibility.\n\n\"Our mission is to serve everyone, including people who might be unfamiliar with using maps, with clear and up-to-date location information during emergencies,\" said John Mills, CEO of Watch Duty. \"Mapbox gives us the tools to build fast, intuitive maps that just work — even when usage spikes and the stakes are high.\"\n\nThe Critical Importance of Clear, Customized Map Design Initially built with open-source tools, Watch Duty switched to Mapbox basemaps and geocoding for its superior performance and design flexibility. Mapbox excels at satisfying highly specific design requirements, even the finer details such as using the correct, locally-recognized road shield icons across different states so that users can easily recognize roads when interpreting the map and planning evacuation routes.\n\n\"Doing things like getting the highway interstate signs right was impossible on our earliest versions built with Esri, Leaflet, and OpenStreetMap. With Mapbox, we can customize our map design however we need to,\" said Mills. \"Watch Duty is all about user experience, because during a disaster, our map has to be easy to use. Mapbox is the only map provider that seems to get this.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nMapbox also provides unmatched control over the order, styling, and visibility of map layers — giving Watch Duty the ability to preserve map legibility even while displaying numerous overlapping layers showing evacuation zones, fire perimeters, power outages, red flag weather warnings, and more. Using the Mapbox Studio map styling interface, the Watch Duty engineers can more efficiently collaborate with designers to fine-tune the basemap styling.\n\n\"The map style editor in Mapbox Studio is an incredible tool,\" said Dave Merritt, CTO of Watch Duty. \"Watch Duty has so many map layers, the overall visual clarity of our map styles is essential. Mapbox Studio allows for a lot more design exploration and ultimately a much more usable and accessible product, which are key tenets for Watch Duty.\"\n\nFrom Maplibre to Mapbox: Performance That Scales After encountering challenges with adding features and fixing bugs when using the open source mapping software Maplibre, Watch Duty migrated to the latest version of Mapbox GL JS, using Capacitor to serve the app on both web and mobile platforms. Building with the Mapbox map renderer has improved map performance and enables easier maintenance and feature development for the Watch Duty engineers.\n\n\"Watch Duty migrated from Maplibre GL to Mapbox GL JS because we needed a more usable, robust mapping platform,\" said Merritt. \"Our migration was fast, and the performance gains have been immediate.\"\n\nThe expanded partnership between Mapbox and Watch Duty includes ongoing collaboration to further enhance the performance and design of Watch Duty's maps based on continued feedback from public and first responders.\n\nBuilding for Unpredictable Demand with a Predictable Partner Watch Duty experiences rapid, large-scale usage surges during wildfire events. Ensuring reliable performance during spikes is a challenge for any application and developer team, but especially critical during emergencies. The Mapbox platform provides the reliability that Watch Duty requires to be able to serve millions of requests per second.\n\n\"Free open source software alone would never be enough to do what we're doing, at the level of demand that we serve,\" said Mills. \"Having a technology partner like Mapbox means that we are able to scale with confidence and keep providing this critical service to the public.\"\n\nThe partnership ensures that Watch Duty can continue offering the best map experience to its users. It also engages the geospatial engineering expertise of Mapbox developers to rapidly resolve issues and co-develop valuable new features to support emergency response and wildfire safety.\n\n\"Watch Duty has an incredible attention to detail and they raise the bar on the life-saving assistance they provide to so many communities across the US. The Mapbox team is excited to partner with their innovative team,\" said Wong. \"Mapbox product teams and engineers drive geospatial innovation for our customers every day, but it is a special honor to support an application that helps to keep so many people safe.\"\n\nAbout Watch Duty Watch Duty is a nonprofit organization that delivers real-time emergency information to the public. Powered by a network of volunteers, firefighters, dispatchers, and technologists, its mission is to ensure that communities receive accurate and timely emergency information about wildfires through alerts when they need it most.

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s Jensen Huang spent months telling everyone what a grave mistake the US was making restricting shipments of artificial intelligence processors to China — with little sign that his argument was swaying anyone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\nThen, very suddenly, that all changed.\n\nLate on Monday, the chipmaker said it received assurances that the US government would allow it to export some chips to the Asian nation. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Nvidia’s chief rival, quickly followed with a similar announcement. These export license approvals could generate billions of dollars in total revenue for the companies this year — and they mark a dramatic reversal after the Trump administration said the issue wasn’t even up for debate.\n\nHuang has taken almost every opportunity available to him — from the stage of tech events to Washington visits — to argue that a crackdown on China is counterproductive. During his appearances, he navigated a fine line between praising Trump policies aimed at bringing back chip manufacturing to the US and demanding more freedom to do business in China.\n\nJust last week, Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House.\n\n“Jensen has done a wonderful job at advocating to the administration,” said Matthew Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. The CEO has catered to the White House’s interest in investing in the US, “while at the same time advocating his views on the importance that US AI should flow freely,” he said.\n\nWhen Nvidia announced its plans to reenter the China market, Huang was visiting Beijing, attending a government-sponsored event and meeting officials to discuss “safe and secure AI for the benefit of all,” according to a company statement. Nvidia said it was assured that licenses would be granted by the US government and “hopes to start deliveries soon.”\n\n“It is a positive signal not only for Nvidia and its related supply chain but also for broader markets given its implications for US-China trade talks,” said Richard Clode, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors.\n\nStill, there’s no guarantee the new approvals will lead to flourishing business in China. Nvidia and AMD aren’t certain how many chips the new export licenses will cover or how long they will last, according to a person familiar with the matter. In China, the US chipmakers are only permitted to sell older, limited versions of their products. And many buyers in the country, where companies are rapidly churning out AI models, have moved to local suppliers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt’s also not clear how much Huang’s lobbying turned the tide. The concession was part of broader US negotiations with China, which the White House said will accept higher tariffs and cooperate on rare-earth minerals.\n\n“Senior administration officials are pretty clearly characterizing this as having been explicitly traded for what we got in those talks,” said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.\n\nHuang has argued that restrictions in China mean American chipmakers will cede the immense market to local rivals, chiefly Huawei Technologies Co. White House AI adviser David Sacks has echoed that, calling for an American “tech stack” — a set of complementary hardware and software services that the nation can export and control. Sacks, a tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist, was critical in reversing recent semiconductor restrictions to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, arguing that the Gulf powerhouses would otherwise turn to China for their growing AI ambitions.\n\n“We are not selling the latest and greatest chips to China,” Sacks said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. “The policy is nuanced, and it makes a lot of sense.”\n\nBut there’s another contingent who view chip bans as a key way to keep Beijing from advancing in what’s widely seen as an AI arms race. The abrupt about-face this week came as a shock to many China hawks in the administration and on Capitol Hill, leaving several privately fuming, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nMany policymakers were in the dark on how the changes will be implemented and raced to get a better understanding of the mechanics, said these people, who asked not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nThe House select committee on China plans to seek clarification from the Commerce Department on the reversal, according to the panel’s Republican chairman, Representative John Moolenaar. “It is crucial that the US maintain its lead” and keeps advanced AI out of the hands of the Chinese Communist Party, he said in a statement.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that the policy change makes sense because Nvidia and AMD won’t be selling their latest chips in the market. “We want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology. They still rely upon it, and that’s key,” he said. “So we try to play that balance. We don’t sell them our best stuff.”\n\nThe US first restricted Nvidia’s sales in China in 2022, placing curbs designed to keep the most advanced AI resources from the Chinese military. In response, Nvidia designed new processors, including the H20. It’s an AI accelerator with certain components — such as memory access — deliberately limited to comply with US bans. Officials under President Joe Biden weighed the idea of placing restrictions on the H20 but ultimately didn’t.\n\nTrump then went ahead with the curbs in April, citing national security concerns.\n\nA month later, Huang said the US government was shooting itself in the foot with the policy. “All in all, the export controls were a failure. The facts would suggest it,” he told reporters in Taipei. He also said demand in China for AI chips would reach $50 billion in 2026 — a market that Trump basically kept his company out of.\n\nNvidia’s products are central to the creation and running of artificial intelligence software. The company has more than a 90% share in AI accelerators — chips that are the key component in giant data centers being built around the world.\n\nAccess to the chips have become a negotiating card for Trump during his trips to the Middle East, where he secured massive pledges from Gulf states to invest in the US. Along the way, he’s praised Huang for going further than some other tech CEOs, such as Apple Inc.’s Tim Cook.\n\nDuring a trip to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump scanned the crowd for the tech luminaries who joined him for an event.\n\nHe spotted Huang. “Thank you very much, Jensen. I mean, Tim Cook isn’t here. But you are,” the president said. “What a job you’ve done.”\n\n--With assistance from Laura Avetisyan, Brunella Tipismana Urbano and Alicia Diaz.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThailand’s Changing Cannabis Rules Leave Farmers in a Tough Spot The New Third Rail in Silicon Valley: Investing in Chinese AI How Hims Became the King of Knockoff Weight-Loss Drugs ‘The Turbulence Is Brutal’: Four Shark Tank Businesses on Tariffs Will Trade War Make South India the Next Manufacturing Hub?\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) is unchanged, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) is down -0.55%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) is up +0.51%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) are up +0.02%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) are up +0.57%.\n\nStock indexes rallied early the session due to a favorable core CPI print of +0.2% m/m, but then faded as T-note prices fell and as expectations for a Fed rate cut in September were trimmed to 58% from 65%.  The 10-year T-note yield is currently up +4.8 bp and the 30-year T-bond yield rose back above the 5% mark for the first time in 6 weeks. Join 200K+ Subscribers: Find out why the midday Barchart Brief newsletter is a must-read for thousands daily.\n\nThe Dow was undercut by negative breadth with 24 of the 30 stocks showing declines, led by Merck (MRK) and American Express (AXP).\n\nToday’s CPI report received some favorable initial media attention due to the slightly weaker-than-expected +0.2% m/m increase in the core CPI, which was driven partly by lower car prices.  However, there were some scattered signs of upside pressure from tariffs, and that pressure is expected to increase in the coming months.  Also, both the headline and core CPI reports on a year-over-year basis rose from May.\n\nSpecifically, the June US CPI rose +0.3% m/m, which was in line with market expectations, while the year-over-year figure of +2.7% was slightly worse than expectations of +2.6% and was up from May’s +2.4%.  The June US core CPI rose +0.2% m/m, which was slightly better than expectations of +0.3%.  On a year-over-year basis, the June US core CPI was in line with expectations at +2.9% y/y but rose from May’s +2.8%.\n\nExpectations for a -25 bp Fed rate cut were little changed for the July FOMC meeting but were trimmed to 58% for the September meeting from 65% on Tuesday.  Federal funds futures prices are discounting the chances for a -25 bp rate cut at 3% at the July 29-30 FOMC meeting and at 58% at the following meeting on Sep 16-17.\n\nThere was some positive trade news today after Treasury Secretary Bessent said that US-China trade talks are in a “very good place” and that the US-China deadline is flexible and told market participants “not to worry about August 12.”  Mr. Bessent confirmed that the Trump administration has told Nvidia that a license for the sale of its advanced H20 GPU chips to Chinese firms will be granted and is “all part of a mosaic” in the US-China negotiations.  He also said he hopes to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in August.\n\nStocks have been undercut by recent US trade news.  Over the weekend, President Trump announced that the US will impose 30% tariffs on US imports from the European Union and Mexico, effective August 1.  Mr. Trump said last Thursday that a 35% tariff on some Canadian products would take effect on August 1, up from the current 25%. Last week, Mr. Trump imposed a 50% tariff on copper imports, which will include semi-finished goods, and stated that drug companies could face tariffs as high as 200% on imports if they don’t relocate production to the US within the next year.\n\nToday’s July Empire manufacturing index report of 5.5 was stronger than expectations of -9.2, and was up from June’s level of -16.0.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin (^BTSUSD) is down -3% today due to some long liquidation pressure following the recent rally on hopes for more favorable crypto regulation from Washington.  The US House Committee on Ways and Means plans to hold an oversight subcommittee hearing on July 16 entitled, “Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,” which may lead to more crypto-friendly regulations.\n\nThe markets this week will focus on any fresh news on tariffs or trade deals.  On Wednesday, June PPI final demand is expected to ease to +2.5% y/y from +2.6% in May, and June core PPI is expected to ease to +2.7% y/y from +3.0% y/y in May.  Also, on Wednesday, June manufacturing production is expected to fall by -0.1% m/m.  Finally, on Wednesday, the Fed will release its Beige Book.  On Thursday, June retail sales are expected to climb by +0.1% m/m and +0.3% ex-autos, and weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to climb by +7,000 to 234,000.  Also, on Thursday, the July Philadelphia Fed business outlook survey is expected to climb +3.0 points to -1.0, and the July NAHB housing market index is expected to rise +1 to 33.  On Friday, June housing starts are expected to climb +3.3% m/m to 1.298 million, and June building permits are expected to slip -0.6% m/m to 1.386 million.  Also, the University of Michigan’s US July consumer sentiment index is expected to climb +0.8 to 61.5.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest this week with a focus on big bank earnings results.  Key earnings reports today include Blackrock, Citigroup, JP Morgan, NY Bank of Mellon, Wells Fargo, and State Street. Key earnings reports Wednesday include Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and United Airlines.  Key reports Thursday include PepsiCorp, Abbott, US Bancorp, GE Fifth Third, and GE.  Key reports Friday include Schwab and American Express.\n\nThe consensus is for the S&P 500 companies to show Q2 earnings growth of +2.8% y/y, the smallest increase in two years, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.  Also, only six of the eleven S&P 500 sectors are projected to post an increase in earnings, the fewest since Q1 of 2023, according to Yardeni Research.\n\nOverseas stock markets today are mixed.   The Euro Stoxx 50 is down -0.31%.  China’s Shanghai Composite closed down -0.42%.  Japan’s Nikkei Stock 225 closed up +0.55%.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nSeptember 10-year T-notes (ZNU25) today are down -13.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield is up by +4.8 bp at 4.481%.  T-note prices being undercut by reduced expectations for Fed easing, as the market cut expectations for a rate cut at the September meeting to 55% from 65%.  Also, the 10-year breakeven expectations rate today rose to a 4.75-month high and is currently up +1.5 bp at 2.419%.\n\nAlso on the bearish side for US bond prices, the Trump administration’s campaign against Fed Chair Powell continued today, fueling concern among bond vigilantes about the Fed’s independence and the possibility of politically driven interest rate cuts that could be inflationary.  US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that Fed Chair Powell should step down as a Fed Governor when his term as Chairman ends in May 2026, in line with tradition.  Mr. Powell’s term as a Fed Governor lasts until January 2028, well beyond the expiration of his term as Chairman in mid-May-2026.\n\nMr. Bessent also stated that he is part of a formal process that has already begun to decide who President Trump will appoint as the new Chairman when Mr. Powell’s term ends in May 2026, or earlier “for cause,” based on attacks on how Mr. Powell has handled the renovation of the Fed’s building in Washington.\n\nEuropean government bond yields today are mixed.  The 10-year German bund yield is down -1.9 bp at 2.710%.  The 10-year UK gilt yield is up +2.2 bp at 4.622%.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 2% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the July 24 policy meeting.\n\nUS Stock Movers\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are trading higher today, except for Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA).  Apple (AAPL) Apple is up more than +1% after news that it reached a $500 million deal to buy rare-earth minerals from Pentagon-backed MP Materials Corp.\n\nIn Tesla (TSLA) news today, the company opened its first India showroom.  Also, Bloomberg reported that Tesla’s top sales executive in North America, Troy Jones, has left the company after a 15-year stint.\n\nChip stocks are doing well today after the Trump administration indicated that it will loosen US restrictions on chip sales to China.  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is up more than +6%, and Nvidia (NVDA) is up more than +4% on the news.  Arm Holdings (ARM) is up more than +3%.\n\nCryptocurrency-exposed stocks are mixed today as bitcoin (^BTCUSD) fell -3% on some long liquidation pressure after posting a new record high on Monday. Riot Platforms (RIOT) is down more than -3%, and MicroStrategy (MSTR) is more than -1%, but Coinbase Global (COIN) is up +0.4%.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) is down more than -5% after it reported that long-term asset inflows were less than market expectations.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) is down -0.4% after it raised its full-year expense guidance.\n\nCopper miners are trading lower today after Morgan Stanley downgraded the sector's prospects due to expectations that 50% tariffs will lead to reduced US demand for copper products.  Freeport McMoRan (FCX) is down more than -4%, and Southern Copper (SCCO) is down more than -3%.\n\nEarnings

          "content": "MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine, announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple on Tuesday to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles.\n\nThis news comes on the heels of last week’s announcement that the U.S. Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based company. That will make the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials and help increase magnet production.\n\nDespite their name, the 17 rare earth elements aren’t actually rare, but it’s hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.\n\nThey are important ingredients in everything from smartphones and submarines to EVs and fighter jets, and it's those military applications that have made rare earths a key concern in ongoing U.S. trade talks. That's because China dominates the market and imposed new limits on exports after President Donald Trump announced his widespread tariffs. When shipments dried up, the two sides sat down in London.\n\nThe agreement with Apple will allow MP Materials to further expand its new factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce the magnets that make iPhones vibrate. The company expects to start producing magnets for GM's electric vehicles later this year and this agreement will let it start producing magnets for Apple in 2027.\n\nThe Apple agreement represents a tenth of the company's pledge to invest $500 billion domestically during the Trump administration. And although the deal will provide a significant boost for MP Materials, the agreement with the Defense Department may be even more meaningful.\n\nNeha Mukherjee, a rare earths analyst with Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that the Pentagon's 10-year promise to guarantee a minimum price for the key elements of neodymium and praseodymium will guarantee stable revenue for MP Minerals and protect it from potential price cuts by Chinese producers that are subsidized by their government.\n\n“This is the kind of long-term commitment needed to reshape global rare earth supply chains,\" Mukherjee said.\n\nTrump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths. His administration is both helping MP Materials and trying to encourage the development of new mines that would take years to come to fruition. China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply. The fear is that the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements that could disrupt production of a variety of products. MP Materials can't satisfy all of the U.S. demand from its Mountain Pass mine in California’s Mojave Desert.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe deals by MP Materials come as Beijing and Washington have agreed to walk back on their non-tariff measures: China is to grant export permits for rare earth magnets to the U.S., and the U.S. is easing export controls on chip design software and jet engines. The truce is intended to ease tensions and prevent any catastrophic fall-off in bilateral relations, but is unlikely to address fundamental differences as both governments take steps to reduce dependency on each other.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters David Klepper and Didi Tang contributed to this report from Washington D.C.

          "content": "We recently published Jim Cramer Analyzed These 9 Stocks As He Said Tariffs Are Better Than CIA Coups. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a regular feature of Cramer’s morning show. Earlier during the year, the CNBC host defended the stock after shares struggled due to weakness in the Chinese smartphone market. Cramer continued to defend Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) after analysts soured on its Siri and perceived AI weakness. He continued to defend the company, and this time, Cramer discussed reports suggesting that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO Tim Cook should leave the company:\n\n“[On analysts saying Tim Cook should leave] I wanted to say, I thought it was outrageous. I thought that was outrageous. I wish that I could’ve, that I would love to be able to be Tim Cook and say what I’ve done for the shareholders. And it’s just incredible. The amount of wealth that man has created. I mean that’s like when I saw, at one point today I saw in premarket that NVIDIA was down. I was going to call for Jensen’s firing. . .I mean come on. . .you know Jensen has to go. Can we like stop? Like stop? Like Tim Cook’s great.”Apple Inc. (AAPL): It's \"Outrageous\" To Say Tim Cook Should Leave, Says Jim Cramer\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nCramer discussed key traits for a potential Tim Cook successor earlier. Here is what he said:\n\n“[On Morgan Stanley saying Tim Cook’s successor could benefit from having a hardware background] Well look, it’s funny hardware is part of the, I’m glad you mentioned hardware, hardware’s part of the issue of how NVIDIA got to where it is. This is an essentially, there’s a belief in many people on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley, that hardware prevails here because we’re gonna get rid of a huge number of people who would do SaaS, you know, software as a service, and that includes, yes, Salesforce, includes ServiceNow, includes DataDog which got out of the S&P. Because there are going to be fewer and fewer people who are actually in the organization who need that. But that does not mean that you wouldn’t need more Apple.”\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

          "content": "What Happened?\n\nShares of apple device management company, Jamf (NASDAQ:JAMF) jumped 7.2% in the morning session after the company announced it expects to exceed the high end of its second-quarter 2025 guidance and revealed a new strategic reinvestment plan. The Apple device management company now anticipates both revenue and non-GAAP operating income to surpass its previous forecasts. The original guidance for the second quarter, which ended June 30, projected total revenue between $167.5 million and $169.5 million, with non-GAAP operating income of $29.5 million to $30.5 million. In a move to bolster long-term growth, Jamf also announced a strategic plan that includes reducing its workforce by about 6.4% and reallocating resources. The company will increase its focus on enterprise customers and accelerate investments in artificial intelligence. While the restructuring will result in one-time charges of $11.0 million to $12.5 million, investors appear to be focused on the positive outlook and the company's efforts to improve operational efficiency and drive future profitability.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down to $8.30, up 1% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Jamf? Access our full analysis report here, it’s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nJamf’s shares are somewhat volatile and have had 12 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock dropped 3.9% after a broader market sell-off triggered by renewed trade tensions. U.S. stock indices fell after the Trump administration announced intentions to impose a 35% tariff on many goods imported from Canada.\n\nThis move is far more than a typical trade dispute; it targets the United States' largest and most deeply integrated trading partner. Canada is not merely a neighbor but a critical component of North American supply chains, particularly in sectors like automotive, energy, and critical minerals.\n\nThis move sparked concerns about potential retaliatory actions and a wider impact on the North American economy, leading to a risk-off sentiment among investors. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all opened lower, pulling back from recent record highs and heading for their first weekly loss in three weeks.\n\nJamf is down 41.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $8.30 per share, it is trading 56.1% below its 52-week high of $18.91 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Jamf’s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $211.74.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.\n\nView Comments",

US stocks trading mixed today after a relatively tame CPI report failed to ease Wall Street's concerns about the impact of tariffs. Traders on Wall Street now largely expecting the Fed to keep rates on hold at its July meeting. Plus, investors are also monitoring earnings from Wall Street's biggest banks. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond said on the company's earnings call that President Trump's trade policies pose quote significant risk to the US economy. He also stressed the importance of Fed independence. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reporting yet another high-level departure at Tesla. Troy Jones, who was Tesla's top sales executive in North America, has departed the EV maker after 15 years at the company. The departure comes as Tesla is facing a steep drop in sales. And MP materials shares surging today after Apple struck a $500 million deal with the company to buy rare earth minerals. Apple said the spending on rare earth minerals is part of its earlier pledge to invest more than $500 billion in the US economy. And that's Yahoo Finance market minute.

          "content": "Applejust announced a $500 million commitment to MP Materials, the only fully integrated rare-earth producer in the United States.\n\nThe multiyear deal, which includes a $200 million upfront payment, will see Apple source American-made rare-earth magnets from MP’s new manufacturing lines in Fort Worth, Texas, and collaborate on a state-of-the-art recycling facility in Mountain Pass, California.\n\nThe move, which sent MP’s stock skyrocketing 23% Tuesday morning, not only signals a shift in supply-chain tactics, but also a broader geopolitical hedge as tensions with China escalate.\n\nBuilding a domestic magnet powerhouse\n\nAt the heart of the agreement is Apple’s pledge to buy neodymium magnets, the most widely used type of rare-earth magnet on the planet—essential for iPhones, Macs, and AirPods—manufactured at MP Materials’ Texas facility. The deal will fund the buildout of advanced production lines tailored for Apple’s needs, with the first shipments expected by 2027.\n\nBy supplying Apple, MP Materials’ Texas plant is positioned to become a key node in the global rare-earths market, supporting “dozens of new jobs in advanced manufacturing and R&D,” according to Apple’s press release.\n\nAs part of the deal, Apple and MP will also launch a dedicated recycling line in California, designed to process rare-earth materials from used electronics and post-industrial scrap. This facility will help Apple in achieving its goal of using 100% recycled rare-earth elements in its devices—a milestone the company has already achieved for nearly all magnets across its product lineup.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how many jobs Apple expects to create directly and indirectly through this partnership, which types of roles will be prioritized, and what development or training programs will Apple and MP Materials launch or lean on to facilitate manufacturing. Apple did not immediately respond to Fortune‘s request for comment.\n\nInsulating against China\n\nThis move between Apple and MP Materials comes as the rare-earths market faces intensifying geopolitical headwinds. China currently controls over 90% of global rare-earth magnet production and refining capacity, according to The New York Times, making it a critical chokepoint for the world’s technology supply chains. In recent years, Beijing has demonstrated a willingness to leverage its dominance as a geopolitical tool, raising the specter of export restrictions or price shocks during periods of trade tension.\n\nBy investing heavily in domestic production and recycling, Apple is essentially pre-bunkering its supply chain—proactively securing access to critical components before the next global disruption.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe deal with MP Materials, which is also backed by recent Pentagon funding, is widely seen as a strategic hedge against future trade restrictions, tariffs, or diplomatic rifts that could threaten the steady flow of rare earths from China. It also deepens Apple’s control over its component pipeline, from raw material extraction to recycling and final assembly.\n\nApple’s broader U.S. industrial strategy\n\nThis rare-earths initiative dovetails with Apple’s sweeping $500 billion U.S. investment plan, which includes major outlays in semiconductors, AI infrastructure, and workforce development. Recent projects include:\n\nA new AI server manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, supporting Apple’s next-generation “Apple Intelligence” platform. Expansion of domestic chip production and supplier training academies, aimed at building a robust ecosystem of U.S.-based tech talent and manufacturing partners. A projected 20,000 new U.S. jobs in R&D, silicon engineering, and advanced manufacturing over the next four years.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nBy investing in domestic rare-earth production and recycling, Apple is proactively insulating itself from geopolitical shocks, particularly those stemming from China’s dominance in rare earths and its willingness to weaponize export controls. Apple also gets to advance its environmental goals through this deal, which strengths its brand among consumers and investors to some degree. But it also serves as a high-profile example of the kind of investment President Trump has long demanded from Silicon Valley, aligning with his administration’s push to reshore manufacturing, create American jobs, and reduce reliance on foreign—especially Chinese—supply chains. Trump’s tariff threats appear to be having an impact.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView Comments",

          "content": "NEW YORK, July  16, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in Apple, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nInvestors have until August 19, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Apple securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Tucker v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 5:25-cv-05197.\n\nWhy was Apple Sued for Securities Fraud?\n\nApple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of smart-devices and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Apple’s software includes a digital personal assistant called “Siri,” which was first introduced in October 2011. The complaint alleges that Apple misrepresented Siri’s advanced AI-based features as well as its ability to deliver them within the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nIn truth, as alleged, Apple lacked a functional prototype of Siri’s purported advanced AI-based features and misrepresented the time it would take to integrate such features into its devices.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced it was indefinitely delaying several AI-based Siri features, citing development delays and pushing their release to sometime “in the coming year.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $11.59 per share, or almost 5%, from $239.07 per share on March 7, 2025, to $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nThen, on June 9, 2025, Apple hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference for 2025. Noticeably, Apple failed to announce any new updates regarding advanced Siri features. Analysts and media outlets described the WWDC as “underwhelming” and “disappointing,” with CNN stating that “it’s unlikely that any of the announcements made at Monday’s event will change the perception that Apple is behind its competitors in AI.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $2.47 per share, or over 1%, from $203.92 on June 6, 2025, to $201.45 per share on June 9, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Apple you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

          "content": "Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shares tick higher in pre-market trading after the company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, though looming pharmaceutical tariffs from President Trump remain a key risk for the sector.\n\nMP Materials (MP) stock jumped after Apple (AAPL) announced a $500 million deal to buy rare earth magnets and build a rare earth recycling facility in California.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief: Market Sunrise here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Speaker A\n\nNow some more breaking news on the earnings front, as the pharma sector braces for more clarity on tariffs. Johnson & Johnson reporting earnings this morning, kicking off earnings for the healthcare sector. The company reporting second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.77, but keep, keep part of this release really is the company boosting its full-year sales outlook and boosting its full-year earnings outlook, its profit outlook. So Johnson & Johnson now seeing full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $10.80 to $10.90, previously it had guided for a range of $10.50 to $10.70. On full-year sales, the company now sees a range of $93 or sorry, $93.2 billion to $93.6 billion, previously it had seen a range of 91 to 91.8. So you're seeing stock slightly higher here up a little bit over 1% on this boosted forecast. But key though for the sector, as we had talked about earlier this morning for Johnson & Johnson, is the fact that pretty soon President Trump has warned that there will be tariffs coming on the pharma sector. So it will be interesting to see of course how those could impact this company, what management says on the call about this about those tariffs and looming risks when it comes to that. Now you might have also heard about MP Materials in recent days. That stock closed 20% higher on Tuesday, and this is another trending ticker that I want to highlight for us. That stock is up about 4.5% in pre-market up almost 4% now. The fresh surge in MP, that's the ticker, comes after Apple announced that it would buy rare earth magnets from the company in a $500 million deal. The deal will sell, we'll see Apple and MP materials launch a recycling facility in California for processing and we'll be keeping a close eye on MP materials over the next several sessions.

Those looking for passive income will find compelling opportunities in these three positions. Various industries are represented in the portfolio, such as AI, electric vehicles, and energy. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nWarren Buffett -- one of the most highly esteemed investors of all time, if not the most -- has been a consistent source of investing insights for decades. In addition to his numerous pearls of wisdom, the stock purchases Buffett makes through his conglomerate, BerkshireHathaway, are also closely followed.\n\nHere are 10 stocks from the Berkshire portfolio that bear the Buffett seal of approval and are worth loading up on right now.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThough not a major holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) demands serious consideration from investors seeking exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), e-commerce, and other segments. Its Amazon Web Services unit, in particular, continues to be a great growth engine for the company, and it will likely remain so for many years to come as AI flourishes.\n\nShares look attractively valued now at 17.7 times operating cash flow, compared to its five-year average cash flow multiple of 20.4.\n\n2. Apple\n\nThe largest holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has plunged almost 16% year to date as of this writing. Thanks to its fiercely loyal customer base, it steadily generates strong profits and cash flows.\n\nWith the haircut it has received so far in 2025, investors have the chance to pick up shares of the tech stalwart at a lower price point than when the year began.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC), one of the nation's largest financial institutions, demonstrated its sound financial health during the recent 2025 stress test. It has rewarded shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend over the past decade, making Bank of America a great choice for those interested in a leading financial stock, but who are not interested in large exposure to the risks in smaller regional banks.\n\n4. BYD\n\nAlthough BYD's (OTC: BYDD.F) electric vehicles (EV) aren't seen on American highways and byways, the company's dominance in the global EV market is indisputable. Investors have pumped the brakes on BYD stock over the past month, and shares are available on the cheap, trading at 2.5 times forward earnings.\n\n5. Chevron\n\nFor an opportunity to add ample passive income into investors' portfolios, there's Chevron(NYSE: CVX). This oil giant has consistently increased its dividend -- now offering a 4.5% forward yield -- for nearly four decades. Despite the downturn in energy prices over the past year, Chevron stock has remained resilient, demonstrating its allure as a way to gain energy exposure.\n\nStory Continues\n\n6. Coca-Cola\n\nThe fourth-largest Berkshire Hathaway position, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), first appeared in the portfolio in 1988. The company, founded in 1886, now owns a variety of beverage brands beyond soft drinks, making it the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company. It's a Dividend King, having logged 63 consecutive years of payout growth.\n\n7. Kraft Heinz\n\nDown about 17% since the start of 2025, Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) has fallen out of favor with investors due to lagging sales, yet there are numerous reasons not to dismiss this food and beverage leader. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, and shares are inexpensively valued at 10.1 times forward earnings.\n\n8. Moody's\n\nThe credit ratings, research, and risk analysis services that Moody's(NYSE: MCO) provides allow businesses and investors to make more informed financial decisions. Its invaluable services will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future, making it a worthy consideration for investors looking to fortify their portfolios with a more conservative opportunity.\n\n9. Occidental Petroleum\n\nUnlike Chevron's operations up and down the energy value chain, OccidentalPetroleum(NYSE: OXY) is an oil and gas company focused (though not exclusively) on exploration and production in the United States. This business model means the stock is highly correlated with energy prices, illustrating why it's down almost 25% over the past year. But the shares should recover and be a long-term winner.\n\n10. Visa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) has about 1.3 billion credit cards in circulation worldwide, an impressive global presence. With the various fees it collects from users, the company generates consistently strong cash flows. From 2015 through 2024, for example, Visa grew its free cash flow at a 15% compound annual rate.\n\nThe stock has provided stellar returns for investors over the long term, and the company's growth potential suggests that its shares will soar even higher in years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "Investors are cooling on Apple (AAPL) as other tech giants race ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\nNew York Life Investments economist and portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin and Yahoo Finance Senior Reporter Allie Canal join Opening Bid host Brian Sozzi to discuss why Apple's slow rollout of AI features has left it behind peers that are already delivering consumer use cases.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Opening Bid here.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n00:00 Brian Sozzi\n\nAll right, it's time now for our question of the day. How popular is Apple's stock right now? Uh, maybe not such a crazy question. Here's why I'm bringing this up. In today's BFA fund manager survey, it was noted that in the past three months, since April, global investors have raised their allocation to the tech sector by the largest amount since March 2009. During that span, though, Apple stock has underperformed Google, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia by a country mile. Lauren, what happened to Apple? It used to be I mean, everybody seemingly owns Apple, but now they are perhaps owning more of everything else in the AI space.\n\n00:43 Lauren\n\nWell, I can't speak to Apple specifically, but I can speak to something I see very clearly happening within this, uh, this tech space. We've spoken a lot today about the foundational layer of artificial intelligence, the semiconductor chip makers, uh, manufacturers. Um, we haven't spoken as much about the infrastructure layer, the energy companies. And then there's a third layer, the application layer. And this is where many companies outside of Apple have had more early, um, releases, opportunities for their customers to deeply engage with new functions related to AI and what that can do in their daily lives. And that application layer, we are really only in the very earliest, I would even say pre-stages of what that will look like, not only for us as consumers, but also for businesses and the technologies that they use to enable their workforce. And so I would say, um, the jury is still certainly out over who the winners and losers will be. And elements of, um, data and personal security, where Apple has historically been strong, might be areas that, uh, gain more importance as this application layer builds out.\n\n02:34 Brian Sozzi\n\nUh, Allie, I I'm going to decode this movement in in, uh, Apple in real time. I'm using my iPhone to download AI applications from everybody else. And until Apple comes out with its own AI functions, they need to do They're not They're unlikely to regain that story, that that bullish thesis.\n\n03:02 Alexandra Canal\n\nYeah, and that's a big reason why we've seen these year-to-date declines. They've just disappointed on the AI story. And fun fact, B. Brian, Nvidia is $1 trillion larger than Apple at the current moment. That just gives some perspective here. But to Lauren's point, the use cases on the consumer side for AI, we just haven't been there yet. And that's an area that down the line, Apple could potentially double down on it, and we could see that momentum. Right now, it's really focused on those hyperscalers, a lot of B2B, for a company like Meta that's been utilized by its advertisers, especially its smaller advertisers. So that's why we've been able to to see these outside gains in some of these other MAG 7 companies. Apple typically They're not the innovators here. They usually sit back, they wait for the innovators to to do their thing, and then they come in and make a better product. So that could be something that we see down the line here. Uh, you know, Apple also focused on that user privacy data. We have seen some, you know, shaky data with, uh, Chat GPT, Gemini, those types of products. So again, something that Apple might just want to sit on their heels and wait a little bit.\n\n04:43 Brian Sozzi\n\nJust fix Siri, please, Apple, and tell us things aren't going to be, uh, bad in China.

The U.S. does not reach such a deal with China.\n\nFebruary 10 - Trump raises tariffs on steel and aluminum to a flat 25% \"without exceptions or exemptions\".\n\nMarch 3 - Trump says 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada will take effect from March 4 and doubles fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports to 20%.\n\nMarch 6 - Trump exempts goods from Canada and Mexico under a North American trade pact for a month.\n\nMarch 26 - Trump unveils a 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks.\n\nApril 2 - Trump announces global tariffs with a baseline of 10% across all imports and significantly higher duties on some of the United States’ biggest trading partners.\n\nApril 9 - Trump pauses for 90 days most of his country-specific tariffs that kicked in less than 24 hours earlier after an upheaval in financial markets erased trillions of dollars from bourses around the world.\n\nThe 10% blanket duty on almost all U.S. imports stays in place.\n\nTrump says he will raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125% from the 104% level that took effect a day earlier. This pushes the extra duties on Chinese goods to 145%, including the previously imposed tariffs.\n\nMay 9 - Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announce a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place 10% tariffs on British exports and lowers U.S. duties on British car exports.\n\nMay 12 - The U.S. and China agree to temporarily slash reciprocal tariffs.

          "content": "Key Points\n\nBerkshire is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings on Saturday, Aug. 2.  There are a few numbers that Berkshire investors will be watching closely. Berkshire’s stock looks like a strong value right now. 10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway ›\n\nBerkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) presents its earnings reports a little differently. For one thing, management doesn't hold quarterly earnings calls like most companies do. And CEO Warren Buffett insists on releasing earnings reports on Saturdays, so investors will have plenty of time to digest the numbers before the stock market opens.\n\nThere are a few key numbers investors will be watching when Berkshire reports its second-quarter results, expected on Saturday, Aug. 2. Berkshire's operating earnings from its businesses is the most obvious example. There's also the company's cash stockpile, which reached an all-time high of $347.7 billion at the end of the first quarter.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »\n\nFinally, while we won't know what specific stocks Berkshire bought and sold until a few weeks after its earnings report when it has to file with the government, we can typically figure out if Berkshire was a net buyer or seller of stocks during the quarter by looking at the reported cost basis of its investment portfolio. And we'll also get details about whether Berkshire decided to buy back any of its own stock.\n\nIn this article, I'll discuss why this trillion-dollar company could be a solid investment before earnings.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBerkshire should be more valuable now\n\nDuring the second quarter, which is the period Berkshire is getting ready to report, the S&P 500 increased by 10.4%, and many of Berkshire's top stock holdings performed quite well. Although Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell slightly during the quarter on tariff concerns, Berkshire's second- and third-largest investments, American Express(NYSE: AXP) and Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), increased by 20% and 15%, respectively, during the second quarter. Despite all of this, Berkshire's stock is significantly lower than where it started the quarter, mainly because CEO Warren Buffett announced his retirement at the company's May annual meeting.\n\nAlso, while we won't know Berkshire's stock portfolio activity for the second quarter until mid-August, it's highly likely that Berkshire's already massive $348 billion cash stockpile has grown even larger. However, as I'll discuss in a bit, I also wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that Berkshire had resumed buybacks in the second quarter, which could limit the growth of the company's cash.\n\nFinally, Berkshire has a collection of (mostly) tariff-resistant businesses. Of course, there could still be some secondary impacts of tariffs on businesses that operate exclusively in the U.S., but Berkshire is more insulated from the impacts of import tariffs than most.\n\nA better value than you might think\n\nAt the current stock price, Berkshire Hathaway has a market cap of about $1.02 trillion, which is significantly less than just a couple months ago, before Buffett announced his planned retirement. Meanwhile, the value of the stock portfolio has increased significantly, and Berkshire still has the same (or more) cash.\n\nThink of it this way. Berkshire's stock portfolio is worth approximately $292 billion as of this writing. Removing that and the $348 billion in cash shows a valuation of about $380 billion for Berkshire's operating businesses.\n\nWe'll get updated numbers soon, but Berkshire has generated about $33 billion in operating profit from its businesses over the past four quarters, excluding investment income. This shows that the market is valuing Berkshire's businesses at just 11.5 times operating earnings. The last time I looked at the numbers was late May, and this ratio was 14. That's why I wouldn't be shocked if we find out Berkshire resumed buybacks.\n\nIs Berkshire a buy before earnings?\n\nTo be sure, I have no idea what Berkshire Hathaway's earnings will be, and some parts of the report (insurance underwriting income, for example) can be rather unpredictable. But the bottom line is that this is a rock-solid business trading well below highs at a time when the S&P 500 is near its all-time peak.\n\nWarren Buffett's departure isn't likely to have any massive impact on the day-to-day business; Berkshire still has an excellent team of leaders; and the company has unmatched financial flexibility to pursue opportunities if and when they arise. Berkshire is already one of the largest stock investments in my portfolio, but if the current price level persists, I'm likely to add shares. It is a buy before earnings.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you're looking to park in an investment worth owning for a while? That's easier said than done right now. Although the market isn't exactly dangerous at this time, stocks are relatively expensive, given the degree of economic uncertainty ahead.\n\nNevertheless, a handful of tickers are not only still worth owning here but also worth buying at their current prices. If you need help finding some of these names, just start with the stocks Warren Buffett is holding, if not buying more of.\n\nTo this end, here's a closer look at three stocks currently found in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio that would likely be at home in your portfolio, too.\n\nSirius XM Holdings\n\nIt's not entirely clear what Buffett himself sees in Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI), but he clearly sees something. Berkshire's 110 million-share stake in the company is one-third of Sirius itself, thanks to the purchase of another $42 million worth of the stock just within the past few days.\n\nOf course, Sirius XM is North America's one and only satellite radio service, although the company is more than that. In addition to web-accessible access to its satellite-delivered programming, Sirius owns the internet radio platform Pandora. Roughly three-fourths of its revenue comes from subscription fees, and most of the rest comes from advertising.\n\nIt's a business model that's being increasingly questioned, and understandably so. There's a virtual universe of audio entertainment available online, and Pew Research reports that 90% of adults living in the United States own a smartphone -- they have their own web-connected entertainment device with them at all times, in and out of a vehicle.\n\nConsumers arguably don't need satellite radio anymore. In this vein, the company's subscriber base has dwindled from its late-2022 peak of nearly 32.4 million to just under 31.5 million paying customers as of the middle of this year. It's not catastrophic, but it is a concern.\n\nThis attrition may also have run its full course, however, and is set to reverse direction. Sirius is still adding new podcasts, overhauling its pricing plans, and -- thanks to the introduction of an advertising-sales technology (Trade Desk's Unified ID 2.0, to be specific) -- is well positioned to grow the advertising aspect of its business, which will ultimately make its programming cheaper (or even free) to tune in to. This will also create and free up funds to do more marketing.\n\nOf course, Sirius XM stock's forward-looking dividend yield of 4% isn't too shabby either.\n\nOccidental Petroleum\n\nOil and gas stocks haven't always been Warren Buffett's cup of tea. Although most of these tickers pay good dividends when they can, these companies' bottom lines are closely tethered to unpredictable oil prices. The Oracle of Omaha generally isn't into these kinds of guessing games.\n\nThat's what makes his commitment to energy outfit Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) so interesting -- and telling. Since it was first added to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio back in 2022, not only has Buffett continued to add to the position, but he's also made a point of touting it. As he wrote in this year's letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders:\n\nUnder Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country.\n\nBuffett adds, \"We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States,\" most of which are in the well-proven Permian Basin and nearby areas.\n\nBut wait -- isn't the crude oil business on its way out? Not so fast.\n\nWhile renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are obviously the future, there's a growing need for power right now. It could take decades for this transition to do any permanent damage to the oil and gas business. Indeed, Bloomberg expects demand for oil to continue growing through 2035, with this demand only waning about 10% from that 2035 peak by 2050.\n\nTranslation: There's a lot of money to be made by extracting oil and gas from the ground in the meantime. Now, all of a sudden, Warren Buffett's seemingly unlikely interest in Occidental makes a lot of sense.\n\nBank of America\n\nFinally, add Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) to your list of Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now.\n\nIt's an eyebrow-raising call. If you keep tabs on Warren Buffett's trades, then you likely know Berkshire's been shedding its Bank of America (BofA) stake since the middle of this year, paring back its position in the big bank by about one-fourth of its peak size. He's still actively selling this stock, too. Plenty of investors have been interpreting these sales as a sign of impending trouble for the bank.\n\nAnd, perhaps, Buffett is concerned about the company's foreseeable future.\n\nThere's also a distinct possibility, however, that Berkshire's simply scaling back on a (very) profitable trade before potential changes in tax laws can go into effect that might make unrealized gains on big trades taxable. In this vein, Berkshire has also been selling pieces of its profitable position in Apple of late, which is still Berkshire's biggest trade despite the recent culling.\n\nAlso, even with the frantic panic resulting from the streak of sales since July, the remaining 766 million-share, $32.4 billion stake in BofA leaves it as Berkshire's third-biggest holding. Maybe Buffett is just trying to reduce his position in BofA to less than 10% of the bank itself, which lifts the requirement to immediately disclose any buys or sales of the stock in question.\n\nSure, like most other banks, this one's grappling with waning loan demand and rising loan defaults. Last quarter's net interest income slipped 3% year over year, while charge-offs for soured loans -- although still absorbable -- grew 65% for the same timeframe.\n\nThere's a reason shares of Bank of America have been climbing since August's low, however, and are back within sight of new 52-week highs. Take that hint while the stock's forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 2.5%. You'll be plugging into one of the biggest leading names in a business the world absolutely needs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Sirius XM wasn’t one of them.

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump said he was likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month and that levies on semiconductors could come soon as well, suggesting that those import taxes could hit alongside broad “reciprocal” rates set for implementation on Aug. 1.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\n“Probably at the end of the month, and we’re going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we’re going to make it a very high tariff,” Trump told reporters Tuesday as he returned to Washington after attending an artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh.\n\nTrump also said his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors was “similar” and that it was “less complicated” to impose levies on chips, without providing additional detail.\n\nAt a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said he planned to impose a 50% tariff on copper in the coming weeks, and that he expected pharmaceutical tariffs to grow as high as 200% after giving companies a year to bring manufacturing back to the US. Trump has already announced investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on drugs, arguing a flood of foreign imports was threatening national security.\n\nStill, any tariffs could immediately impact drugmakers like Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. that produce drugs overseas — and risks driving up costs for US consumers. So does Trump’s plans for semiconductor tariffs, which are expected to hit not only the chips themselves but popular products like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronic Co. laptops and smartphones.\n\nThe threat came as Trump in recent days has sent letters to a number of trading partners unilaterally dictating the rates for tariffs on many imports — while maintaining he would continue to carry out negotiations. Earlier Tuesday, Trump announced an agreement with Indonesia reducing the 32% rate announced in one of the letters to 19%. Indonesia agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets as part of the agreement, the US said.\n\nTrump on Tuesday predicted that he could strike “two or three” trade deals with countries before implementing his so-called reciprocal tariffs before they are implemented on Aug. 1, saying that an agreement with India was among the most likely.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrump told reporters the US was engaged in substantive discussions with between five and six countries, but that he wasn’t necessarily inclined to finalize agreements over simply dictating a tariff rate.\n\n“I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I’m very happy with the letters,” Trump said.\n\nThe president also said that he was likely to impose a standard tariff of “probably a little over 10%” on smaller countries that did not receive tailored rates.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump said representatives from the European Union — which faces a 30% tariff — would be meeting with US negotiators this week. After returning from Pittsburgh, Trump said that while some countries had indicated a willingness to “open” trade after his threats — including South Korea — others, like Japan, had not.\n\nTrump also dismissed concerns that his threat earlier in the week to impose “secondary” tariffs on Russian trading partners if Moscow did not agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine could impact US consumers, even as experts warned the president risked driving up energy costs with his plan.\n\n“I don’t think so. I think that whole thing is going to go away,” Trump said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget DOGE.

          "content": "(Bloomberg) -- US President Donald Trump said he reached a deal with Indonesia that will see goods from the country face a 19% tariff, while US exports will not be taxed.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThe Dutch Intersection Is Coming to Save Your Life Advocates Fear US Agents Are Using ‘Wellness Checks’ on Children as a Prelude to Arrests LA Homelessness Drops for Second Year Manhattan, Chicago Murder Rates Drop in 2025, Officials Say\n\n“They are paying 19% and we are not paying anything,” Trump told reporters Tuesday at the White House. “We are going to have full access to Indonesia.”\n\nTrump has sent tariff letters over the last week to multiple trading partners, increasing pressure on negotiators ahead of an Aug. 1 deadline for higher duties to take effect. A pact with Indonesia, which was threatened with a 32% tariff, would be the first struck with a country targeted by one of those messages to reduce their rate.\n\nIndonesia also agreed to purchase $15 billion in US energy, $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co. jets, “many of them 777’s,” Trump said later on social media.\n\n“If there is any Transshipment from a higher Tariff Country, then that Tariff will be added on to the Tariff that Indonesia is paying,” the president added.\n\nMarkets have been in wait-and-see mode on Trump’s trade proclamations, given he has changed rates and deadlines multiple times since he announced country-by-country tariffs on April 2 and then quickly paused them. Boeing shares increased as much as 0.8% on the announcement, while the dollar rose 0.4% on Tuesday. The S&P 500 was little changed after earlier topping 6,300.\n\nTrump initially announced the accord on social media, without providing specifics. He said he dealt directly with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto to finalize the deal.\n\nIndonesia is preparing a joint statement with the US that will detail additional information, including non-tariff measures and commercial agreements, Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs Secretary Susiwijono Moegiarso said in a text message late Tuesday in Jakarta.\n\nEarlier: Indonesia Touts ‘Sweetener’ as Negotiators Meet US Officials\n\nIndonesia’s top negotiator, Minister Airlangga Hartarto, last week met with US officials, including Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, to hash out an improved agreement.\n\nSoutheast Asia’s largest economy had earlier proposed near-zero tariffs on about 70% of US imports, as well as business deals in critical minerals, energy, agriculture and defense, but that failed to convince Trump to lower the levy on Indonesian goods from the 32% rate he first set back in April.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAn agreement with Indonesia would be the fourth trade framework Trump has announced since pausing his country-specific tariffs, after Vietnam and the UK. The US and China also reached a tariff truce that includes the planned resumption of critical minerals and technology trade between the world’s two largest economies.\n\nThe pacts have thus far fallen short of full-fledged trade deals, with many details left to be negotiated later. Trump provided no paper to back up last week’s claim of a deal with Vietnam. The country’s leadership was caught off guard by Trump’s declaration that Hanoi agreed to a 20% tariff, and the Vietnamese government is still seeking to lower the rate, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nEarlier: Apparel Tariffs Outside China: Is Vietnam’s 20% the New Normal?\n\nTrump has kept foreign governments and investors on edge about his tariff agenda, with partners rushing to avoid higher import taxes and markets facing yet another dose of uncertainty. The US president indicated Monday he preferred to stick with the levies in his letters, saying, “I really don’t want deals. I just want the paper to get sent.”\n\nThe president also said he was willing to continue talks with major economies, including the European Union.\n\nTrump over the last week unleashed a barrage of tariff demand letters, informing other economies of new duties set to begin Aug. 1 if they cannot negotiate better terms with the US. The missives extended what was initially a July 9 deadline for another three weeks, setting off another frantic dash of negotiations.\n\nThe slew of tariff threats from Trump have prompted economies to broaden trade ties beyond the US; Indonesia reached a tentative economic agreement with the EU over the weekend.\n\n“There is quite a level of frustration with these deals and more talk about exploring those other options, to include Europe,” said Erin Murphy, senior fellow on emerging Asia economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nSoutheast Asian nations — loathe to choose between the US and China — have long been caught in the middle of economic and political battles between the two superpowers. While Vietnam is said to be further along in trade negotiations with the US, Thailand is in ongoing talks and mulling how to reduce US duties without giving away too much and stoking domestic unrest.\n\nPhilippine officials also are pushing to secure a pact ahead of the new deadline, with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. set to visit Washington later this month in an effort to reduce or eliminate Trump’s planned 20% tariff on the island nation.\n\n--With assistance from Grace Sihombing and Claire Jiao.\n\n(Adds markets in sixth paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget DOGE.

The lawsuit claims that Apple misled investors about its artificial intelligence (AI) features, specifically regarding Siri's advanced capabilities and the timeline for delivering them in the iPhone 16. The complaint states that Apple did not have a working version of these advanced AI features and misrepresented how long it would take to include them in its devices.\n\nThe truth about these delays surfaced in two key instances:\n*   On 07-03-2025, Apple announced an indefinite delay for several AI-based Siri features. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped by $11.59, nearly 5%, from $239.07 to $227.48 per share.\n*   On 09-06-2025, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) did not feature any new updates on advanced Siri features. Media outlets described the event as \"underwhelming,\" and CNN noted that Apple appeared to be behind competitors in AI. This led to a further stock price decline of $2.47, over 1%, from $203.92 to $201.45 per share.\n\nInvestors who bought Apple shares and experienced losses may have legal options. They are encouraged to contact BFA Law by 19-08-2025 to potentially be a lead plaintiff in the case. There is no upfront cost for investors to participate in this legal action.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nThe lawsuit against Apple for alleged misrepresentation of its AI capabilities, specifically Siri, carries several important implications:\n\n*   Investor Trust Erosion: The core of the lawsuit suggests Apple may have provided misleading information about its technological progress. This can damage investor confidence in the company's forward-looking statements and future innovations.\n*   Financial Repercussions: If found liable, Apple could face significant financial penalties or settlements, impacting its earnings and cash flow. The lawsuit seeks compensation for investors who lost money due to the alleged misrepresentations.\n*   Market Perception of AI Development: The news highlights the challenges and potential for overstatement in the rapidly evolving AI sector. It signals to the broader market that claims of advanced AI features need to be scrutinized, particularly when they influence stock valuations.\n*   Stock Price Volatility: The documented stock price declines on 07-03-2025 (a nearly 5% drop from $239.07 to $227.48) and 09-06-2025 (over 1% drop from $203.92 to $201.45) directly demonstrate how investor disappointment and perceived delays in promised features can negatively impact a company's market value.\n*   Operational Scrutiny: The allegations suggest potential issues within Apple's AI development and integration processes. This could lead to increased internal and external scrutiny of the company's product roadmaps and R&D effectiveness.\n*   Shareholder Rights: This class action serves as an example of how shareholders can seek recourse when they believe a company's management has acted in a way that harms their investments due to false or misleading statements.\n\n2025-07-16T12:19:00+00:00\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/16/3116371/0/en/AAPL-INVESTOR-LOSS-A-Class-Action-was-filed-on-behalf-of-Apple-Inc-NASDAQ-AAPL-Investors-Contact-BFA-Law-by-August-19-if-you-Suffered-Losses.html"

Apple received the highest possible rating of 100% based on its financial strength and stock price relative to its value. This strategy looks for companies that consistently make money over a long period, have little debt, and are reasonably priced. Apple, a large company in the communications equipment sector, passed all nine important tests in this analysis, including its ability to predict earnings, manage debt, generate returns for owners, produce cash, and handle its share buybacks. The report highlights that a score of 90% or above indicates strong interest from this investment method.\n\nAnalysis and Insight\n\n*   The 100% rating for Apple (AAPL) using a Warren Buffett-inspired strategy suggests the company exhibits qualities sought by long-term, value-oriented investors, despite being a prominent growth stock.\n*   Passing all nine fundamental tests indicates Apple's strong financial health and operational discipline across various key areas, including profitability, debt management, and shareholder returns.\n*   This analysis supports the view that Apple possesses predictable earnings, efficient use of capital, and a robust financial structure, aligning with a conservative investment philosophy focused on durable businesses.\n*   For investors, this provides an independent validation that Apple's current fundamentals and valuation are attractive according to a historically successful investment approach known for seeking safe, high-quality businesses.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/aapl-factor-based-stock-analysis-warren-buffett-2"

However, potential new government taxes on medicines from President Trump are a concern for the company and the entire drug industry. Separately, MP Materials' stock went up significantly after Apple announced a half-billion-dollar deal to buy special magnets from them and work together on a recycling plant in California.\n\nNews Analysis\n\n*   Johnson & Johnson's higher financial forecasts usually indicate strong business performance, which generally boosts investor confidence. However, the looming threat of government taxes on pharmaceutical products creates uncertainty for the entire sector, potentially offsetting some of the positive sentiment from the increased outlook. Companies like Johnson & Johnson will need to address how they plan to manage these potential new costs.\n*   MP Materials' significant deal with Apple highlights the increasing demand for critical rare earth materials, which are essential for advanced technologies.

Despite a widespread increase in tech investments, Apple's stock has trailed behind competitors like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia, which are already providing AI features for consumers. Experts suggest that these rivals have been quicker to release AI applications that deeply engage users. While Apple has historically prioritized data privacy and security, which could become more important in the future of AI, its current slow pace in offering its own AI functions means users are downloading AI apps from other companies onto their Apple devices. This has contributed to a decline in Apple's stock this year, with Nvidia now holding a significantly larger market value. Apple often waits for others to innovate before releasing its own refined products, a strategy that some believe it is employing for AI, especially considering privacy concerns with existing AI offerings.\n\nNews Impact Analysis:\n*   Apple's stock performance is under pressure because it is perceived as falling behind in the race to develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence features for consumers.\n*   Investors are actively reallocating their capital towards tech companies that are demonstrating clear leadership and innovation in AI, causing Apple to lose market share and investor preference relative to its peers.\n*   The market is currently prioritizing immediate AI advancements and visible use cases. Apple's traditional approach of observing initial innovations before releasing its own perfected products is currently seen as a disadvantage, contributing to its stock's underperformance and a significant shift in market capitalization, as exemplified by Nvidia now being $1 trillion larger than Apple.\n*   While Apple's strong focus on user privacy and data security may offer a long-term advantage as AI technologies mature, the company needs to introduce tangible AI functionalities to reignite investor enthusiasm and regain its competitive edge.\n*   For Apple to reverse its stock's decline and recapture investor confidence, it must deliver on its own AI story by launching compelling and integrated AI features, rather than just serving as a platform for others' AI applications.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lags-ai-race-means-103016559.html"

          "content": "NEW YORK, July  16, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and certain of the Company’s senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.\n\nIf you invested in Apple, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nInvestors have until August 19, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Apple securities. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and is captioned Tucker v. Apple Inc., et al., No. 5:25-cv-05197.\n\nWhy was Apple Sued for Securities Fraud?\n\nApple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the businesses of smart-devices and artificial intelligence (“AI”). Apple’s software includes a digital personal assistant called “Siri,” which was first introduced in October 2011. The complaint alleges that Apple misrepresented Siri’s advanced AI-based features as well as its ability to deliver them within the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nIn truth, as alleged, Apple lacked a functional prototype of Siri’s purported advanced AI-based features and misrepresented the time it would take to integrate such features into its devices.\n\nThe Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Apple announced it was indefinitely delaying several AI-based Siri features, citing development delays and pushing their release to sometime “in the coming year.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $11.59 per share, or almost 5%, from $239.07 per share on March 7, 2025, to $227.48 per share on March 10, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nThen, on June 9, 2025, Apple hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference for 2025. Noticeably, Apple failed to announce any new updates regarding advanced Siri features. Analysts and media outlets described the WWDC as “underwhelming” and “disappointing,” with CNN stating that “it’s unlikely that any of the announcements made at Monday’s event will change the perception that Apple is behind its competitors in AI.” On this news, the price of Apple stock declined $2.47 per share, or over 1%, from $203.92 on June 6, 2025, to $201.45 per share on June 9, 2025, the following trading day.\n\nClick here for more information: https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/apple-inc-class-action-lawsuit.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\n\nIf you invested in Apple you may have legal options and are encouraged to submit your information to the firm.\n\nAll representation is on a contingency fee basis, there is no cost to you.

Johnson & Johnson reporting earnings this morning, kicking off earnings for the healthcare sector. The company reporting second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.77, but keep, keep part of this release really is the company boosting its full-year sales outlook and boosting its full-year earnings outlook, its profit outlook. So Johnson & Johnson now seeing full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $10.80 to $10.90, previously it had guided for a range of $10.50 to $10.70. On full-year sales, the company now sees a range of $93 or sorry, $93.2 billion to $93.6 billion, previously it had seen a range of 91 to 91.8. So you're seeing stock slightly higher here up a little bit over 1% on this boosted forecast. But key though for the sector, as we had talked about earlier this morning for Johnson & Johnson, is the fact that pretty soon President Trump has warned that there will be tariffs coming on the pharma sector. So it will be interesting to see of course how those could impact this company, what management says on the call about this about those tariffs and looming risks when it comes to that. Now you might have also heard about MP Materials in recent days. That stock closed 20% higher on Tuesday, and this is another trending ticker that I want to highlight for us. That stock is up about 4.5% in pre-market up almost 4% now. The fresh surge in MP, that's the ticker, comes after Apple announced that it would buy rare earth magnets from the company in a $500 million deal. The deal will sell, we'll see Apple and MP materials launch a recycling facility in California for processing and we'll be keeping a close eye on MP materials over the next several sessions.

          "content": "Key Points\n\nApple, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola are among Berkshire Hathaway's largest holdings. Those looking for passive income will find compelling opportunities in these three positions. Various industries are represented in the portfolio, such as AI, electric vehicles, and energy. 10 stocks we like better than Amazon ›\n\nWarren Buffett -- one of the most highly esteemed investors of all time, if not the most -- has been a consistent source of investing insights for decades. In addition to his numerous pearls of wisdom, the stock purchases Buffett makes through his conglomerate, BerkshireHathaway, are also closely followed.\n\nHere are 10 stocks from the Berkshire portfolio that bear the Buffett seal of approval and are worth loading up on right now.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThough not a major holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) demands serious consideration from investors seeking exposure to artificial intelligence (AI), e-commerce, and other segments. Its Amazon Web Services unit, in particular, continues to be a great growth engine for the company, and it will likely remain so for many years to come as AI flourishes.\n\nShares look attractively valued now at 17.7 times operating cash flow, compared to its five-year average cash flow multiple of 20.4.\n\n2. Apple\n\nThe largest holding in the Berkshire portfolio, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has plunged almost 16% year to date as of this writing. Thanks to its fiercely loyal customer base, it steadily generates strong profits and cash flows.\n\nWith the haircut it has received so far in 2025, investors have the chance to pick up shares of the tech stalwart at a lower price point than when the year began.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC), one of the nation's largest financial institutions, demonstrated its sound financial health during the recent 2025 stress test. It has rewarded shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend over the past decade, making Bank of America a great choice for those interested in a leading financial stock, but who are not interested in large exposure to the risks in smaller regional banks.\n\n4. BYD\n\nAlthough BYD's (OTC: BYDD.F) electric vehicles (EV) aren't seen on American highways and byways, the company's dominance in the global EV market is indisputable. Investors have pumped the brakes on BYD stock over the past month, and shares are available on the cheap, trading at 2.5 times forward earnings.\n\n5. Chevron\n\nFor an opportunity to add ample passive income into investors' portfolios, there's Chevron(NYSE: CVX). This oil giant has consistently increased its dividend -- now offering a 4.5% forward yield -- for nearly four decades. Despite the downturn in energy prices over the past year, Chevron stock has remained resilient, demonstrating its allure as a way to gain energy exposure.\n\nStory Continues\n\n6. Coca-Cola\n\nThe fourth-largest Berkshire Hathaway position, Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), first appeared in the portfolio in 1988. The company, founded in 1886, now owns a variety of beverage brands beyond soft drinks, making it the world's largest nonalcoholic beverage company. It's a Dividend King, having logged 63 consecutive years of payout growth.\n\n7. Kraft Heinz\n\nDown about 17% since the start of 2025, Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC) has fallen out of favor with investors due to lagging sales, yet there are numerous reasons not to dismiss this food and beverage leader. The company continues to generate strong operating cash flow, and shares are inexpensively valued at 10.1 times forward earnings.\n\n8. Moody's\n\nThe credit ratings, research, and risk analysis services that Moody's(NYSE: MCO) provides allow businesses and investors to make more informed financial decisions. Its invaluable services will remain in high demand for the foreseeable future, making it a worthy consideration for investors looking to fortify their portfolios with a more conservative opportunity.\n\n9. Occidental Petroleum\n\nUnlike Chevron's operations up and down the energy value chain, OccidentalPetroleum(NYSE: OXY) is an oil and gas company focused (though not exclusively) on exploration and production in the United States. This business model means the stock is highly correlated with energy prices, illustrating why it's down almost 25% over the past year. But the shares should recover and be a long-term winner.\n\n10. Visa\n\nVisa(NYSE: V) has about 1.3 billion credit cards in circulation worldwide, an impressive global presence. With the various fees it collects from users, the company generates consistently strong cash flows. From 2015 through 2024, for example, Visa grew its free cash flow at a 15% compound annual rate.\n\nThe stock has provided stellar returns for investors over the long term, and the company's growth potential suggests that its shares will soar even higher in years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

How popular is Apple's stock right now? Uh, maybe not such a crazy question. Here's why I'm bringing this up. In today's BFA fund manager survey, it was noted that in the past three months, since April, global investors have raised their allocation to the tech sector by the largest amount since March 2009. During that span, though, Apple stock has underperformed Google, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia by a country mile. Lauren, what happened to Apple? It used to be I mean, everybody seemingly owns Apple, but now they are perhaps owning more of everything else in the AI space.\n\n00:43 Lauren\n\nWell, I can't speak to Apple specifically, but I can speak to something I see very clearly happening within this, uh, this tech space. We've spoken a lot today about the foundational layer of artificial intelligence, the semiconductor chip makers, uh, manufacturers. Um, we haven't spoken as much about the infrastructure layer, the energy companies. And then there's a third layer, the application layer. And this is where many companies outside of Apple have had more early, um, releases, opportunities for their customers to deeply engage with new functions related to AI and what that can do in their daily lives. And that application layer, we are really only in the very earliest, I would even say pre-stages of what that will look like, not only for us as consumers, but also for businesses and the technologies that they use to enable their workforce. And so I would say, um, the jury is still certainly out over who the winners and losers will be. And elements of, um, data and personal security, where Apple has historically been strong, might be areas that, uh, gain more importance as this application layer builds out.\n\n02:34 Brian Sozzi\n\nUh, Allie, I I'm going to decode this movement in in, uh, Apple in real time. I'm using my iPhone to download AI applications from everybody else. And until Apple comes out with its own AI functions, they need to do They're not They're unlikely to regain that story, that that bullish thesis.\n\n03:02 Alexandra Canal\n\nYeah, and that's a big reason why we've seen these year-to-date declines. They've just disappointed on the AI story. And fun fact, B. Brian, Nvidia is $1 trillion larger than Apple at the current moment. That just gives some perspective here. But to Lauren's point, the use cases on the consumer side for AI, we just haven't been there yet. And that's an area that down the line, Apple could potentially double down on it, and we could see that momentum. Right now, it's really focused on those hyperscalers, a lot of B2B, for a company like Meta that's been utilized by its advertisers, especially its smaller advertisers. So that's why we've been able to to see these outside gains in some of these other MAG 7 companies. Apple typically They're not the innovators here. They usually sit back, they wait for the innovators to to do their thing, and then they come in and make a better product. So that could be something that we see down the line here. Uh, you know, Apple also focused on that user privacy data. We have seen some, you know, shaky data with, uh, Chat GPT, Gemini, those types of products. So again, something that Apple might just want to sit on their heels and wait a little bit.\n\n04:43 Brian Sozzi\n\nJust fix Siri, please, Apple, and tell us things aren't going to be, uh, bad in China.

          "text": "News Headline\n\nApple Sued Over Alleged Siri AI Misrepresentations, Investors Advised to Act\n\nNews Condensation\n\nA lawsuit has been filed against Apple Inc. and its senior executives by the law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP. The lawsuit claims that Apple misled investors about its artificial intelligence (AI) features, specifically regarding Siri's advanced capabilities and the timeline for delivering them in the iPhone 16. The complaint states that Apple did not have a working version of these advanced AI features and misrepresented how long it would take to include them in its devices.\n\nThe truth about these delays surfaced in two key instances:\n*   On 07-03-2025, Apple announced an indefinite delay for several AI-based Siri features. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped by $11.59, nearly 5%, from $239.07 to $227.48 per share.\n*   On 09-06-2025, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) did not feature any new updates on advanced Siri features. Media outlets described the event as \"underwhelming,\" and CNN noted that Apple appeared to be behind competitors in AI. This led to a further stock price decline of $2.47, over 1%, from $203.92 to $201.45 per share.\n\nInvestors who bought Apple shares and experienced losses may have legal options. They are encouraged to contact BFA Law by 19-08-2025 to potentially be a lead plaintiff in the case. There is no upfront cost for investors to participate in this legal action.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nThe lawsuit against Apple for alleged misrepresentation of its AI capabilities, specifically Siri, carries several important implications:\n\n*   Investor Trust Erosion: The core of the lawsuit suggests Apple may have provided misleading information about its technological progress. This can damage investor confidence in the company's forward-looking statements and future innovations.\n*   Financial Repercussions: If found liable, Apple could face significant financial penalties or settlements, impacting its earnings and cash flow. The lawsuit seeks compensation for investors who lost money due to the alleged misrepresentations.\n*   Market Perception of AI Development: The news highlights the challenges and potential for overstatement in the rapidly evolving AI sector. It signals to the broader market that claims of advanced AI features need to be scrutinized, particularly when they influence stock valuations.\n*   Stock Price Volatility: The documented stock price declines on 07-03-2025 (a nearly 5% drop from $239.07 to $227.48) and 09-06-2025 (over 1% drop from $203.92 to $201.45) directly demonstrate how investor disappointment and perceived delays in promised features can negatively impact a company's market value.\n*   Operational Scrutiny: The allegations suggest potential issues within Apple's AI development and integration processes. This could lead to increased internal and external scrutiny of the company's product roadmaps and R&D effectiveness.\n*   Shareholder Rights: This class action serves as an example of how shareholders can seek recourse when they believe a company's management has acted in a way that harms their investments due to false or misleading statements.\n\n2025-07-16T12:19:00+00:00\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/16/3116371/0/en/AAPL-INVESTOR-LOSS-A-Class-Action-was-filed-on-behalf-of-Apple-Inc-NASDAQ-AAPL-Investors-Contact-BFA-Law-by-August-19-if-you-Suffered-Losses.html",

Despite a widespread increase in tech investments, Apple's stock has trailed behind competitors like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia, which are already providing AI features for consumers. Experts suggest that these rivals have been quicker to release AI applications that deeply engage users. While Apple has historically prioritized data privacy and security, which could become more important in the future of AI, its current slow pace in offering its own AI functions means users are downloading AI apps from other companies onto their Apple devices. This has contributed to a decline in Apple's stock this year, with Nvidia now holding a significantly larger market value. Apple often waits for others to innovate before releasing its own refined products, a strategy that some believe it is employing for AI, especially considering privacy concerns with existing AI offerings.\n\nNews Impact Analysis:\n*   Apple's stock performance is under pressure because it is perceived as falling behind in the race to develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence features for consumers.\n*   Investors are actively reallocating their capital towards tech companies that are demonstrating clear leadership and innovation in AI, causing Apple to lose market share and investor preference relative to its peers.\n*   The market is currently prioritizing immediate AI advancements and visible use cases. Apple's traditional approach of observing initial innovations before releasing its own perfected products is currently seen as a disadvantage, contributing to its stock's underperformance and a significant shift in market capitalization, as exemplified by Nvidia now being $1 trillion larger than Apple.\n*   While Apple's strong focus on user privacy and data security may offer a long-term advantage as AI technologies mature, the company needs to introduce tangible AI functionalities to reignite investor enthusiasm and regain its competitive edge.\n*   For Apple to reverse its stock's decline and recapture investor confidence, it must deliver on its own AI story by launching compelling and integrated AI features, rather than just serving as a platform for others' AI applications.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lags-ai-race-means-103016559.html",

The lawsuit claims that Apple misled investors about its artificial intelligence (AI) features, specifically regarding Siri's advanced capabilities and the timeline for delivering them in the iPhone 16. The complaint states that Apple did not have a working version of these advanced AI features and misrepresented how long it would take to include them in its devices.\n\nThe truth about these delays surfaced in two key instances:\n*   On 07-03-2025, Apple announced an indefinite delay for several AI-based Siri features. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped by $11.59, nearly 5%, from $239.07 to $227.48 per share.\n*   On 09-06-2025, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) did not feature any new updates on advanced Siri features. Media outlets described the event as \"underwhelming,\" and CNN noted that Apple appeared to be behind competitors in AI. This led to a further stock price decline of $2.47, over 1%, from $203.92 to $201.45 per share.\n\nInvestors who bought Apple shares and experienced losses may have legal options.

There is no upfront cost for investors to participate in this legal action.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nThe lawsuit against Apple for alleged misrepresentation of its AI capabilities, specifically Siri, carries several important implications:\n\n*   Investor Trust Erosion: The core of the lawsuit suggests Apple may have provided misleading information about its technological progress. This can damage investor confidence in the company's forward-looking statements and future innovations.\n*   Financial Repercussions: If found liable, Apple could face significant financial penalties or settlements, impacting its earnings and cash flow. The lawsuit seeks compensation for investors who lost money due to the alleged misrepresentations.\n*   Market Perception of AI Development: The news highlights the challenges and potential for overstatement in the rapidly evolving AI sector. It signals to the broader market that claims of advanced AI features need to be scrutinized, particularly when they influence stock valuations.\n*   Stock Price Volatility: The documented stock price declines on 07-03-2025 (a nearly 5% drop from $239.07 to $227.48) and 09-06-2025 (over 1% drop from $203.92 to $201.45) directly demonstrate how investor disappointment and perceived delays in promised features can negatively impact a company's market value.\n*   Operational Scrutiny: The allegations suggest potential issues within Apple's AI development and integration processes. This could lead to increased internal and external scrutiny of the company's product roadmaps and R&D effectiveness.\n*   Shareholder Rights: This class action serves as an example of how shareholders can seek recourse when they believe a company's management has acted in a way that harms their investments due to false or misleading statements.\n\n2025-07-16T12:19:00+00:00\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/16/3116371/0/en/AAPL-INVESTOR-LOSS-A-Class-Action-was-filed-on-behalf-of-Apple-Inc-NASDAQ-AAPL-Investors-Contact-BFA-Law-by-August-19-if-you-Suffered-Losses.html",

The complaint states that Apple did not have a working version of these advanced AI features and misrepresented how long it would take to include them in its devices.\n\nThe truth about these delays surfaced in two key instances:\n*   On 07-03-2025, Apple announced an indefinite delay for several AI-based Siri features. Following this news, Apple's stock price dropped by $11.59, nearly 5%, from $239.07 to $227.48 per share.\n*   On 09-06-2025, Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) did not feature any new updates on advanced Siri features. Media outlets described the event as \"underwhelming,\" and CNN noted that Apple appeared to be behind competitors in AI. This led to a further stock price decline of $2.47, over 1%, from $203.92 to $201.45 per share.\n\nInvestors who bought Apple shares and experienced losses may have legal options. They are encouraged to contact BFA Law by 19-08-2025 to potentially be a lead plaintiff in the case. There is no upfront cost for investors to participate in this legal action.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nThe lawsuit against Apple for alleged misrepresentation of its AI capabilities, specifically Siri, carries several important implications:\n\n*   Investor Trust Erosion: The core of the lawsuit suggests Apple may have provided misleading information about its technological progress. This can damage investor confidence in the company's forward-looking statements and future innovations.\n*   Financial Repercussions: If found liable, Apple could face significant financial penalties or settlements, impacting its earnings and cash flow. The lawsuit seeks compensation for investors who lost money due to the alleged misrepresentations.\n*   Market Perception of AI Development: The news highlights the challenges and potential for overstatement in the rapidly evolving AI sector. It signals to the broader market that claims of advanced AI features need to be scrutinized, particularly when they influence stock valuations.\n*   Stock Price Volatility: The documented stock price declines on 07-03-2025 (a nearly 5% drop from $239.07 to $227.48) and 09-06-2025 (over 1% drop from $203.92 to $201.45) directly demonstrate how investor disappointment and perceived delays in promised features can negatively impact a company's market value.\n*   Operational Scrutiny: The allegations suggest potential issues within Apple's AI development and integration processes. This could lead to increased internal and external scrutiny of the company's product roadmaps and R&D effectiveness.\n*   Shareholder Rights: This class action serves as an example of how shareholders can seek recourse when they believe a company's management has acted in a way that harms their investments due to false or misleading statements.\n\n2025-07-16T12:19:00+00:00\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/16/3116371/0/en/AAPL-INVESTOR-LOSS-A-Class-Action-was-filed-on-behalf-of-Apple-Inc-NASDAQ-AAPL-Investors-Contact-BFA-Law-by-August-19-if-you-Suffered-Losses.html",

Despite a widespread increase in tech investments, Apple's stock has trailed behind competitors like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia, which are already providing AI features for consumers. Experts suggest that these rivals have been quicker to release AI applications that deeply engage users. While Apple has historically prioritized data privacy and security, which could become more important in the future of AI, its current slow pace in offering its own AI functions means users are downloading AI apps from other companies onto their Apple devices. This has contributed to a decline in Apple's stock this year, with Nvidia now holding a significantly larger market value. Apple often waits for others to innovate before releasing its own refined products, a strategy that some believe it is employing for AI, especially considering privacy concerns with existing AI offerings.\n\nNews Impact Analysis:\n*   Apple's stock performance is under pressure because it is perceived as falling behind in the race to develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence features for consumers.\n*   Investors are actively reallocating their capital towards tech companies that are demonstrating clear leadership and innovation in AI, causing Apple to lose market share and investor preference relative to its peers.\n*   The market is currently prioritizing immediate AI advancements and visible use cases. Apple's traditional approach of observing initial innovations before releasing its own perfected products is currently seen as a disadvantage, contributing to its stock's underperformance and a significant shift in market capitalization, as exemplified by Nvidia now being $1 trillion larger than Apple.\n*   While Apple's strong focus on user privacy and data security may offer a long-term advantage as AI technologies mature, the company needs to introduce tangible AI functionalities to reignite investor enthusiasm and regain its competitive edge.\n*   For Apple to reverse its stock's decline and recapture investor confidence, it must deliver on its own AI story by launching compelling and integrated AI features, rather than just serving as a platform for others' AI applications.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lags-ai-race-means-103016559.html",

Despite a widespread increase in tech investments, Apple's stock has trailed behind competitors like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia, which are already providing AI features for consumers. Experts suggest that these rivals have been quicker to release AI applications that deeply engage users. While Apple has historically prioritized data privacy and security, which could become more important in the future of AI, its current slow pace in offering its own AI functions means users are downloading AI apps from other companies onto their Apple devices. This has contributed to a decline in Apple's stock this year, with Nvidia now holding a significantly larger market value. Apple often waits for others to innovate before releasing its own refined products, a strategy that some believe it is employing for AI, especially considering privacy concerns with existing AI offerings.\n\nNews Impact Analysis:\n*   Apple's stock performance is under pressure because it is perceived as falling behind in the race to develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence features for consumers.\n*   Investors are actively reallocating their capital towards tech companies that are demonstrating clear leadership and innovation in AI, causing Apple to lose market share and investor preference relative to its peers.\n*   The market is currently prioritizing immediate AI advancements and visible use cases. Apple's traditional approach of observing initial innovations before releasing its own perfected products is currently seen as a disadvantage, contributing to its stock's underperformance and a significant shift in market capitalization, as exemplified by Nvidia now being $1 trillion larger than Apple.\n*   While Apple's strong focus on user privacy and data security may offer a long-term advantage as AI technologies mature, the company needs to introduce tangible AI functionalities to reignite investor enthusiasm and regain its competitive edge.\n*   For Apple to reverse its stock's decline and recapture investor confidence, it must deliver on its own AI story by launching compelling and integrated AI features, rather than just serving as a platform for others' AI applications.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lags-ai-race-means-103016559.html",

The lawsuit claims that Apple misled investors about its artificial intelligence (AI) features, specifically regarding Siri's advanced capabilities and the timeline for delivering them in the iPhone 16. The complaint states that Apple did not have a working version of these advanced AI features and misrepresented how long it would take to include them in its devices.\n\nThe truth about these delays surfaced in two key instances:\n*   On 07-03-2025, Apple announced an indefinite delay for several AI-based Siri features.

          "text": "J&J Raises Outlook Amid Tariff Concerns; MP Materials Soars on Apple Deal\n\nNews Content\n\nJohnson & Johnson increased its expected full-year profits and sales, causing its stock to rise slightly. However, potential new government taxes on medicines from President Trump are a concern for the company and the entire drug industry. Separately, MP Materials' stock went up significantly after Apple announced a half-billion-dollar deal to buy special magnets from them and work together on a recycling plant in California.\n\nNews Analysis\n\n*   Johnson & Johnson's higher financial forecasts usually indicate strong business performance, which generally boosts investor confidence. However, the looming threat of government taxes on pharmaceutical products creates uncertainty for the entire sector, potentially offsetting some of the positive sentiment from the increased outlook. Companies like Johnson & Johnson will need to address how they plan to manage these potential new costs.\n*   MP Materials' significant deal with Apple highlights the increasing demand for critical rare earth materials, which are essential for advanced technologies. This partnership not only provides a substantial revenue boost for MP Materials but also reinforces its strategic importance in the supply chain. The agreement to establish a recycling facility also points to a growing industry focus on sustainable sourcing and building resilient domestic supply chains for key resources.\n*   Overall, the news illustrates how company-specific financial performance and strategic partnerships directly influence stock prices. It also underscores the importance of considering broader economic and political factors, such as potential tariffs, which can create significant risks or opportunities across different market sectors.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/johnson-johnson-outlook-mp-materials-114541318.html",

          "text": "Headline: Apple's AI Lag Cools Investor Interest\n\nNews Content Overview:\nApple is losing appeal among investors as other major technology companies surge ahead in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Despite a widespread increase in tech investments, Apple's stock has trailed behind competitors like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia, which are already providing AI features for consumers. Experts suggest that these rivals have been quicker to release AI applications that deeply engage users. While Apple has historically prioritized data privacy and security, which could become more important in the future of AI, its current slow pace in offering its own AI functions means users are downloading AI apps from other companies onto their Apple devices. This has contributed to a decline in Apple's stock this year, with Nvidia now holding a significantly larger market value. Apple often waits for others to innovate before releasing its own refined products, a strategy that some believe it is employing for AI, especially considering privacy concerns with existing AI offerings.\n\nNews Impact Analysis:\n*   Apple's stock performance is under pressure because it is perceived as falling behind in the race to develop and deploy cutting-edge artificial intelligence features for consumers.\n*   Investors are actively reallocating their capital towards tech companies that are demonstrating clear leadership and innovation in AI, causing Apple to lose market share and investor preference relative to its peers.\n*   The market is currently prioritizing immediate AI advancements and visible use cases. Apple's traditional approach of observing initial innovations before releasing its own perfected products is currently seen as a disadvantage, contributing to its stock's underperformance and a significant shift in market capitalization, as exemplified by Nvidia now being $1 trillion larger than Apple.\n*   While Apple's strong focus on user privacy and data security may offer a long-term advantage as AI technologies mature, the company needs to introduce tangible AI functionalities to reignite investor enthusiasm and regain its competitive edge.\n*   For Apple to reverse its stock's decline and recapture investor confidence, it must deliver on its own AI story by launching compelling and integrated AI features, rather than just serving as a platform for others' AI applications.\n\n16-07-2025\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-lags-ai-race-means-103016559.html",
